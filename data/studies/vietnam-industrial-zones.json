Roads were poor, power supply was unreliable, port capacity was limited, and the regulatory environment was opaque and inconsistent. For a country seeking to replicate the export-oriented industrialization model of its East Asian neighbors, purpose-built industrial zones offered a solution to these constraints.\n\nThe broader context was the reconfiguration of Asian manufacturing supply chains in the early 1990s. Rising wages in China's coastal provinces, combined with trade tensions and the desire for supply chain diversification, created opportunities for lower-cost manufacturing locations. Vietnam's advantages included a large, young, and literate labor force (literacy rates exceeded 90%), competitive wages (a fraction of Chinese levels), political stability under the Communist Party, and a strategic geographic location between China and ASEAN markets.\n\nMalesky (2004) documented how provincial governments in Vietnam competed intensely for foreign direct investment, using industrial zone development as a primary tool of economic competition. This interprovincial competition, while sometimes producing inefficient duplication, also drove policy innovation and regulatory improvement.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nVietnam's first export processing zone, Tan Thuan, was established in Ho Chi Minh City in 1991 as a joint venture between the city government and a Taiwanese investor. The model provided pre-built factory shells, reliable infrastructure (power, water, telecommunications, waste treatment), streamlined customs and regulatory procedures, and one-stop administrative services within designated zones.\n\nThe government expanded the program rapidly through successive five-year plans. By the early 2000s, three types of zones had been established: export processing zones (exclusively for export-oriented production), industrial zones (for both domestic and export production), and economic zones (larger, multi-functional zones combining industry, services, and residential areas). National legislation, including the revised Investment Law of 2005 and subsequent amendments, provided the legal framework, while provincial People's Committees were given substantial authority over zone development and management.\n\nThe strategy achieved a critical mass when Samsung Electronics chose Vietnam for major manufacturing investments beginning in 2008. Samsung's first factory in Bac Ninh province was followed by facilities in Thai Nguyen and Ho Chi Minh City, with cumulative investment exceeding $17 billion. Samsung's presence catalyzed a broader ecosystem, attracting dozens of Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese component suppliers to establish factories in nearby industrial zones.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBy 2023, Vietnam had established over 400 industrial zones across 61 of its 63 provinces, with a combined area of approximately 130,000 hectares. These zones hosted over 10,000 projects with cumulative registered FDI exceeding $230 billion, representing approximately 65-70% of total FDI into Vietnam. Direct employment in industrial zones exceeded 4 million workers.\n\nThe zones' impact on Vietnam's trade profile was transformative. Manufacturing exports surged from negligible levels in the early 1990s to $336 billion in 2022, making Vietnam one of the world's top 20 exporters. Electronics and components became the leading export category, with Samsung alone accounting for roughly one-fifth of Vietnam's total export value. Textiles, footwear, furniture, and processed food constituted other major industrial zone outputs.\n\nThe industrial zone strategy successfully leveraged Vietnam's position in what economists term the \"China-plus-one\" diversification trend. Research by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) found that Vietnam's industrial zones played a crucial role in attracting investment from companies seeking to reduce concentration in China, particularly after the US-China trade tensions intensified from 2018 onward.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite impressive aggregate figures, Vietnam's industrial zones face significant challenges regarding domestic value addition. The country remains heavily dependent on imported components for assembly, with domestic content in electronics manufacturing estimated at only 5-10%. Linkages between foreign-invested zone firms and domestic suppliers remain weak, limiting technology transfer and the development of indigenous industrial capacity.\n\nLabor standards have been a persistent concern. While wages in industrial zones are higher than agricultural incomes, workers frequently report long overtime hours, exposure to industrial chemicals, and restrictions on independent labor organizing. Malesky and Taussig (2017) found that provincial competition for FDI sometimes manifested as a \"race to the bottom\" in labor and environmental enforcement. Environmental compliance varies widely, with instances of illegal waste discharge and inadequate treatment facilities documented in multiple zones.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Purpose-built industrial zones can overcome infrastructure and institutional constraints that deter foreign investment in early-stage industrializing economies.\n- Anchor investments by major multinational corporations create catalytic effects by attracting supplier ecosystems and building investor confidence.\n- Provincial competition for FDI can drive policy innovation but requires national-level minimum standards to prevent regulatory arbitrage.\n- Moving up the value chain from assembly to higher-value manufacturing requires deliberate policies to build domestic supplier capabilities and human capital.\n- Environmental and labor standards must be embedded in zone governance from the outset to prevent a legacy of social and ecological damage.\n\n## References\n\n- Malesky, E.
