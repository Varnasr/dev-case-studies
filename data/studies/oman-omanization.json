  "content": "## Background\n\nOman's rapid development following Sultan Qaboos bin Said's accession in 1970 transformed the country from one of the most isolated and underdeveloped states in the region into a middle-income economy. However, this transformation was built on imported labor: by the late 1980s, expatriate workers, primarily from South and Southeast Asia, dominated the private sector workforce. The private sector preferred expatriate labor because it was cheaper, more flexible (workers could be easily replaced or deported), and often more experienced than the emerging Omani workforce.\n\nSimultaneously, educated young Omanis expected public-sector employment, which offered higher wages, shorter hours, greater job security, and social prestige. This created a classic dual labor market: Omanis in the public sector and expatriates in the private sector. With government employment approaching saturation and oil revenues insufficient to absorb all nationals into state employment, the structural mismatch became unsustainable.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nOmanization was formally launched in 1988 under the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan. The policy evolved through several phases of increasing specificity and enforcement. The core mechanism is sector-specific quotas: each economic sector is assigned a minimum percentage of Omani employees that firms must maintain. Banking achieved the highest target at 90%, while construction, with its heavy dependence on low-wage labor, had lower requirements.\n\nAl-Lamki (1998) documented the early phase of Omanization, noting that the policy combined mandatory quotas with voluntary incentives, training programmes, and educational expansion. The government invested heavily in Sultan Qaboos University (founded 1986), technical colleges, and vocational training centers to build the human capital pipeline.\n\nAdditional policy instruments included: restricting certain occupations exclusively to Omanis (taxi driving, some retail positions); setting minimum wages for Omani workers in the private sector (higher than expatriate minimum wages); providing wage subsidies to employers hiring Omanis; and establishing the National Training Fund to finance workforce development.\n\nThe policy was reformed multiple times. In 2011, following Arab Spring-inspired protests, the government created 50,000 public-sector jobs and raised public-sector salaries to quell unrest, temporarily relieving pressure but worsening fiscal sustainability. Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, who succeeded Qaboos in 2020, launched Oman Vision 2040 with renewed emphasis on private-sector nationalization and economic diversification.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nResults have been mixed. Omanization has been most successful in sectors where wage differentials between Omanis and expatriates are smallest and skill requirements match educational outputs. The banking and finance sector achieved high Omanization rates (over 90%), and government and state-owned enterprises are predominantly staffed by Omanis (approximately 87%).\n\nHowever, Ennis (2015) found that private-sector Omanization remained stubbornly low, particularly in construction, retail, hospitality, and manufacturing, where expatriates still dominated. The overall private-sector Omanization rate hovered around 15-20%, far below targets. Al-Lamki (1998) had identified the core challenge early: private firms faced cost penalties for hiring Omanis (who commanded higher wages and could not be as easily terminated) and often engaged in cosmetic compliance, registering Omanis on payrolls without assigning meaningful work.\n\nThe dual labor market persisted. Omani youth continued to prefer public-sector employment, with reservation wages above what most private-sector firms offered. Skills mismatches remained significant, with the education system producing graduates whose qualifications did not align with private-sector needs. Youth unemployment among Omanis hovered around 15%, even as hundreds of thousands of expatriate workers filled available positions.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fundamental challenge is economic: in a competitive market, firms hire the most cost-effective labor available. Omanization imposes a cost premium that reduces competitiveness, particularly in tradable sectors. Firms respond through various evasion strategies: ghost workers (registered but not actually employed), tokenism (Omanis in nominal positions), and outsourcing to subcontractors not subject to quotas.\n\nEnnis (2015) argued that Omanization, like similar programmes across the Gulf (Saudization, Emiratization, Bahrainization), addresses the symptom rather than the cause. The root problem is the social contract that guarantees citizens privileged treatment and subsidized lifestyles, creating wage expectations incompatible with private-sector economics.\n\nThe policy creates perverse labor market dynamics. Higher Omani minimum wages incentivize firms to hire cheaper expatriates and pay the quota penalties. The system effectively prices many Omanis out of jobs while simultaneously failing to create productive employment. Women's labor force participation, while growing, remains constrained by social norms and limited private-sector opportunities in conservative regions.\n\nFiscal sustainability is threatened by declining oil revenues and the cost of maintaining the social contract. Oman's credit rating has been downgraded multiple times, and Vision 2040 acknowledges the need for fundamental structural reform including income taxation and subsidy reduction.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Labour nationalization quotas can be effective in regulated sectors (banking, government) but face persistent evasion in competitive, low-margin industries\n- Dual labor markets with different wage floors for nationals and expatriates create perverse incentives that undermine nationalization goals\n- Education and training systems must be aligned with private-sector skills demand, not just expanded in volume\n- Periodic public-sector job creation to address social unrest undermines long-term private-sector employment goals\n- Labour nationalization cannot succeed without addressing the underlying social contract and wage expectations\n- Enforcement mechanisms must go beyond quotas to include genuine workplace integration and career development pathways\n\n## References\n\n1.
