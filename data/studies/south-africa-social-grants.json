  "content": "## Background\n\nSouth Africa's social grant system has its roots in the colonial and apartheid eras, when pensions and disability grants were provided on a racially differentiated basis. White South Africans received generous social assistance, while Black South Africans received only a fraction of the amount, if anything at all. At the end of apartheid in 1994, the new democratic government inherited a system that was deeply inequitable but that provided a foundation for expansion.\n\nPost-apartheid South Africa faced staggering levels of poverty and inequality. Despite being classified as an upper-middle-income country, the legacy of apartheid meant that a large majority of the Black population lived in poverty. Unemployment was extremely high, exceeding 30% by most measures, and income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient was among the worst in the world at approximately 0.63. The new ANC government committed to using social grants as a primary mechanism for poverty reduction.\n\nThe equalization and expansion of social grants became one of the most significant policy achievements of the post-apartheid era. Grant values were equalized across racial groups, and eligibility was progressively expanded to reach the poorest South Africans regardless of race.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe post-apartheid grants system comprises several instruments. The Old Age Pension, available to women over 60 and men over 60 (equalized from previously different ages), provides a monthly income to elderly South Africans. The Disability Grant supports those unable to work due to physical or mental disability. The Child Support Grant (CSG), introduced in 1998, was initially a modest R100 per month for children under seven in the poorest households.\n\nThe CSG underwent dramatic expansion over the following two decades. The age eligibility was progressively raised from under 7 to under 18, and the income means test was adjusted to include more households. By 2023, the CSG reached approximately 12.8 million children at R510 per month. The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), established in 2004, centralized grant administration, replacing the fragmented provincial systems that had been plagued by corruption and inefficiency.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant of R350 per month for unemployed adults aged 18–59 who were not receiving any other social grant. Initially intended as a temporary measure, the SRD grant was repeatedly extended and by 2023 was reaching approximately 8 million additional beneficiaries, effectively creating a de facto basic income grant for the unemployed.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nResearch has consistently demonstrated significant positive impacts of social grants on poverty, nutrition, and human development. Case and Deaton (1998), in early work published in the *Economic Journal*, found that the Old Age Pension substantially reduced poverty in recipient households and was widely shared within extended families, effectively functioning as household rather than individual income support.\n\nWoolard and Leibbrandt (2010) and subsequent research from the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) at the University of Cape Town documented that the Child Support Grant improved children's nutritional status, increased school attendance, and reduced child hunger. Agero, Carter, and Woolard (2007) found evidence that grant receipt facilitated job search by covering transportation costs, challenging the narrative that grants reduced labour supply.\n\nDSD, SASSA, and UNICEF (2012) published a comprehensive impact assessment finding that the CSG was associated with higher school enrollment, better health outcomes for children, and reduced risky behaviours among adolescents. Without social grants, South Africa's poverty rate would be significantly higher; estimates suggest grants reduce the poverty headcount by approximately 8-10 percentage points.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite their scale and impact, social grants have not resolved South Africa's structural poverty and inequality crisis. The grants are too small to lift households above the poverty line, and they do not address the root causes of poverty, including unemployment, spatial inequality, and inadequate education. Critics from the political right argue that grants create dependency, though empirical evidence largely contradicts this claim.\n\nAdministrative challenges have been persistent. The outsourcing of grant payments to private companies, particularly the controversial Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract, led to allegations of fraud, unauthorized deductions from beneficiary accounts, and privacy violations. SASSA's transition to the South African Post Office for payment distribution also encountered significant difficulties. The long-term fiscal sustainability of an expanding grants system in the context of low economic growth and a narrow tax base remains a major concern for policymakers.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Large-scale unconditional cash transfer programmes are administratively feasible and can significantly reduce poverty and improve human development outcomes even in highly unequal middle-income countries.\n- The Child Support Grant demonstrates that progressive expansion of eligibility (gradually raising the age limit and income threshold) can be an effective strategy for scaling social protection.\n- Social grants function as more than individual income support; they are shared within households and extended families, amplifying their poverty reduction impact.\n- Payment systems and administrative infrastructure are critical; outsourcing to private companies without adequate oversight creates risks of fraud and exploitation.\n- Social grants are necessary but insufficient for addressing structural inequality; they must be complemented by investments in education, job creation, and spatial transformation.\n\n## References\n\n- Case, A., & Deaton, A.
