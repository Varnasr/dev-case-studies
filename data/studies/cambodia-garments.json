  "content": "## Background\n\nCambodia's garment industry emerged in the mid-1990s as the country stabilized after decades of conflict, genocide under the Khmer Rouge (1975–1979), and Vietnamese occupation (1979–1989). The 1991 Paris Peace Agreements and subsequent UN-supervised elections in 1993 created conditions for foreign investment, and garment manufacturing was among the first industries to take root. Investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, and South Korea established factories attracted by low labor costs, available labor, and preferential trade access to Western markets.\n\nThe industry grew rapidly from fewer than 20 factories in 1995 to over 200 by 2000, driven primarily by demand from US and European buyers seeking alternatives to quota-constrained producers like China. Cambodia's Most Favored Nation (MFN) status with the United States (granted in 1996) and preferential access to the EU under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative provided critical market access advantages.\n\nThe workforce was overwhelmingly female—approximately 90%—drawn largely from rural areas where agricultural livelihoods were insufficient. For hundreds of thousands of young women, garment factory employment represented their first formal-sector job and a source of income that transformed household economics. Workers typically sent 30–40% of their wages to families in rural provinces, making remittances from garment workers a significant source of rural income.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe most innovative feature of Cambodia's garment sector development was the US-Cambodia Bilateral Textile Agreement (1999–2004), which explicitly linked quota increases for Cambodian garment exports to the US market with improvements in working conditions. This was the first trade agreement to directly condition trade access on labor standards, creating a powerful incentive for compliance.\n\nTo monitor compliance, the International Labour Organization (ILO) established the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) program in 2001, originally called the ILO Garment Sector Project. BFC conducts unannounced factory inspections, publishes synthesis reports on compliance levels across the industry, and provides advisory services to help factories improve conditions. The program monitors issues including working hours, wages, occupational safety and health, child labor, forced labor, and freedom of association.\n\nPolaski (2006) analyzed the program and concluded that the trade-labor linkage created a \"race to the top\" incentive structure in contrast to the typical \"race to the bottom\" dynamic in global garment supply chains. The monitoring created transparency that major buyers—including Gap, H&M, Nike, and Adidas—used to justify sourcing from Cambodia, allowing the country to market itself as an ethical sourcing destination and differentiate from competitors solely on cost.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe industry's economic impact has been transformative. Exports grew from virtually zero in 1995 to $12.1 billion in 2022 (garments and footwear combined), representing approximately 60% of Cambodia's total merchandise exports and contributing roughly 16% of GDP. The sector directly employed over 700,000 workers and supported many more livelihoods through indirect employment.\n\nBFC monitoring data showed measurable improvements in labor compliance over time. By 2019, BFC reported that compliance with minimum wage requirements was near-universal, child labor in monitored factories had been virtually eliminated, and occupational safety compliance had improved substantially from the early years. However, significant issues persisted with excessive overtime, restrictions on freedom of association, and short-term contracts that reduced job security.\n\nStudies have documented the gender empowerment effects of garment sector employment. Asuyama et al. (2013) found that female garment workers in Cambodia earned significantly more than they would have in agriculture or the informal sector, and that employment increased their bargaining power within households. Minimum wage increases from $80/month in 2013 to $204/month in 2024 represented substantial real gains, though wages remained low by global standards.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nLabor rights remain contested despite BFC monitoring. Independent trade unions have faced harassment, and strikes over wages have been met with violence, including the January 2014 shooting of garment workers by security forces during minimum wage protests that killed at least four people. The government has been accused of using the courts and tax authorities to intimidate union leaders. Freedom of association—a core ILO convention—remains the most problematic area of compliance.\n\nThe EU's partial withdrawal of EBA preferences in 2020, citing human rights and democracy concerns under the Hun Sen government, removed tariff-free access for approximately 20% of Cambodia's EU-bound exports (primarily garments and footwear). This demonstrated the vulnerability of a trade-preference-dependent development model to political conditionality. Additionally, Cambodia's extreme dependence on a single low-skill export sector leaves it highly exposed to competition from lower-wage countries including Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia, as well as to automation technologies that could reduce the labor intensity of garment manufacturing.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Trade-labor linkages can create positive incentive structures for improving working conditions, but their effectiveness depends on sustained monitoring and genuine consequences for non-compliance.\n- Independent factory monitoring by credible international organizations like the ILO can provide transparency that benefits both workers and responsible buyers, creating a viable market niche.\n- Garment sector growth can be transformative for women's employment and rural-urban income transfers, but must be accompanied by protections for freedom of association and political rights.\n- Extreme export concentration in a single sector creates vulnerability to trade policy shifts, competition, and technological change.\n- Minimum wage increases in export sectors involve trade-offs between worker welfare and competitiveness that require careful calibration based on productivity growth.\n\n## References\n\n- Polaski, S.
