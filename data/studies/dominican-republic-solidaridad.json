  "content": "## Background\n\nThe Dominican Republic experienced a severe banking crisis in 2003–2004 when the collapse of Banco Intercontinental (Baninter) and other financial institutions led to a government bailout costing an estimated 20% of GDP. The crisis triggered a sharp recession, with inflation reaching 42% and the peso losing half its value. Poverty rates spiked from 32% in 2000 to over 50% by 2004, plunging millions into hardship.\n\nIn response, the administration of President Leonel Fernández (2004–2012) prioritized the construction of a comprehensive social protection system. Drawing on lessons from Latin American CCT programs and supported by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, the government launched the Solidaridad program in 2005 as the centerpiece of its anti-poverty strategy.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nSolidaridad was designed as a conditional cash transfer program providing monthly payments to poor families conditioned on children's school attendance and health check-ups. The program was built on the Sistema Único de Beneficiarios (SIUBEN), a national targeting system that uses proxy means testing to identify eligible households based on observable living conditions rather than self-reported income.\n\nThe SIUBEN classifies households into four poverty categories (ICV 1 through 4, from most to least poor). Solidaridad benefits are concentrated on ICV 1 and 2 households. The registry covered over 2.5 million households by 2012, making it one of the most comprehensive social registries in the Caribbean.\n\nThe program includes several components:\n\n**Comer es Primero** (Eating First): A food subsidy transferred via electronic debit card, providing approximately RD$825 per month for food purchases at authorized stores. This component was designed to improve nutrition while supporting local food markets.\n\n**Incentivo a la Asistencia Escolar** (ILAE): A conditional cash transfer of RD$150–500 per student per month, contingent on 80% school attendance. Higher amounts are provided for secondary students.\n\n**Bono Escolar Estudiando Progreso** (BEEP): An additional education transfer for secondary school students to address the higher dropout rates at that level.\n\nIn 2012, the program was expanded and rebranded as Progresando con Solidaridad (ProSoli) under President Danilo Medina, integrating additional components focused on family accompaniment, financial literacy, and productive inclusion. ProSoli assigned social workers (links familiares) to beneficiary households to provide individualized support.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nGonzález-Rozada (2010) conducted an evaluation of Solidaridad's early years using the discontinuity in SIUBEN scores at the eligibility threshold. The study found positive effects on school attendance, particularly for children at risk of dropping out at the primary-to-secondary transition. Health visit compliance also improved among beneficiary families with children under five.\n\nThe World Bank (2016) assessed the SIUBEN targeting system favorably, finding that it correctly identified 75% of the extreme poor and excluded the majority of non-poor households. The electronic card-based payment system reduced leakage compared to previous cash distribution methods.\n\nThe Comer es Primero component was found to increase food expenditure among beneficiary families by approximately 10%, with improvements in dietary diversity. However, nutritional impact evaluations showed modest effects on child stunting and malnutrition, suggesting that food access alone was insufficient without complementary nutrition education and health services.\n\nThe ProSoli expansion introduced family accompaniment, with over 2,000 social workers conducting regular household visits. Evaluations of this component found improvements in household knowledge of health practices and increased engagement with social services, though the causal attribution was challenging.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nPoliticization of the social protection system has been a persistent concern. Critics have alleged that benefit distribution has been influenced by partisan considerations, particularly during election years. The expansion of beneficiary rolls before elections and the use of social programs for political messaging have raised questions about institutional independence.\n\nConditionality monitoring has been inconsistent. Schools and health facilities have limited capacity to track and report compliance systematically, and penalties for non-compliance have rarely been applied. This raises questions about whether the program functions effectively as a conditional or unconditional transfer.\n\nThe transfer amounts, while supplementing household income, are relatively small relative to the cost of living. Real value has been eroded by inflation, and periodic adjustments have not always kept pace.\n\nGraduation strategies remain underdeveloped. Few beneficiary households have transitioned out of the program through improved economic status, raising concerns about long-term dependency and fiscal sustainability.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Building a comprehensive social registry (SIUBEN) before launching transfer programs enables better targeting and reduces duplication across social programs\n- Electronic payment systems reduce leakage and improve transparency compared to cash distribution\n- Family accompaniment models can enhance the developmental impact of cash transfers but require significant investment in trained social workers\n- Political independence of targeting and benefit distribution mechanisms is essential for program credibility and effectiveness\n- Post-crisis social protection construction can be accelerated when economic shocks generate political will for reform\n\n## References\n\n1.
