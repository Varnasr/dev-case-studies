  "content": "## Background\n\nCosta Rica experienced one of the highest deforestation rates in the world during the mid-twentieth century. Forest cover plummeted from approximately 75% in 1940 to just 21% by 1987, driven by cattle ranching expansion, agricultural frontier clearing, and logging. The country's forests, which harbor approximately 5% of global biodiversity despite covering only 0.03% of the Earth's surface, faced an existential threat.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Costa Rica began implementing conservation policies, including the establishment of national parks covering 25% of the territory. However, deforestation continued on private lands outside protected areas. Recognizing that command-and-control approaches alone were insufficient, policymakers developed a market-based approach to conservation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Pagos por Servicios Ambientales (PSA) program was established through Forestry Law 7575 of 1996 and became operational in 1997. The program recognizes four environmental services provided by forests: carbon sequestration, watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and scenic beauty. Landowners who commit to maintaining or restoring forest cover receive annual payments in exchange for these services.\n\nThe program is administered by the Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal (FONAFIFO), which manages contracts with individual landowners. Payments vary by modality: forest conservation contracts typically pay approximately US$64 per hectare per year, while reforestation contracts provide higher upfront payments. Contract terms are generally five years, renewable.\n\nFunding comes primarily from a 3.5% tax on fossil fuels (established by the same forestry law), supplemented by revenue from carbon credit sales through mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism and voluntary markets, as well as loans and grants from international organizations including the World Bank and the German development bank KfW.\n\nBy 2015, FONAFIFO had issued over 14,000 contracts covering more than one million hectares of forest—approximately 20% of national territory. The program has enrolled indigenous territories, private landowners, and community organizations.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nPagiola (2008) provided a comprehensive assessment of the PSA program, documenting its role in Costa Rica's remarkable forest recovery. Forest cover increased from 21% in 1987 to approximately 52% by 2012. The program contributed to this recovery alongside other factors, including the decline of cattle ranching profitability and the growth of eco-tourism.\n\nHowever, the question of additionality has been the subject of significant academic debate. Robalino and Pfaff (2013) conducted a rigorous evaluation using matching methods and found that the program's impact on deforestation was modest when controlling for selection bias. They showed that many enrolled parcels were at low risk of deforestation regardless of the payment, suggesting that the program was not efficiently targeted at the highest-risk areas. Their estimates indicated that the program avoided deforestation on only about 0.2% of enrolled land annually.\n\nSánchez-Azofeifa et al. (2007) similarly found limited additionality in early phases but noted improvements in targeting over time. Later evaluations have shown that the program became more effective as FONAFIFO refined its targeting criteria to prioritize areas with higher deforestation risk and biological corridors.\n\nDespite additionality concerns, the program has generated co-benefits including institutional strengthening, environmental awareness, and rural income supplementation. Porras et al. (2013) estimated that PES payments represented a significant income share for smallholder participants.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe additionality debate remains the most significant challenge to the PSA program's credibility as a conservation instrument. If payments go primarily to landowners who would have conserved their forests anyway, the program functions more as a transfer payment than an incentive for behavioral change.\n\nEquity concerns have also been raised. Early phases of the program disproportionately enrolled larger landowners who could more easily navigate bureaucratic requirements. Subsequent reforms introduced simplified procedures for smallholders and indigenous communities, but access barriers persist.\n\nThe payment amount (US$64/hectare/year) may be insufficient to compete with the opportunity costs of more profitable land uses in some areas. Where agricultural returns are high, the PSA payment is unlikely to prevent conversion.\n\nLong-term sustainability depends on continued political support for the fuel tax allocation and international carbon market revenues, both of which face uncertainty.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- PES programs can be successfully implemented at national scale with dedicated funding mechanisms like earmarked taxes\n- Additionality is a critical challenge: payments must be targeted at areas with genuine deforestation risk to be cost-effective\n- Forest recovery results from multiple complementary factors—PES alone is unlikely to reverse deforestation without supportive economic conditions\n- Institutional design matters: programs improve over time as targeting and administration are refined based on evaluation evidence\n- Equity provisions require deliberate design, as market-based mechanisms naturally favor larger, better-connected landowners\n\n## References\n\n1.
