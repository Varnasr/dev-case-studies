  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the mid-1990s, many of the world's poorest countries were crushed under unsustainable external debt accumulated during the 1970s and 1980s. This debt originated from a combination of reckless lending by commercial banks and official creditors during the oil boom era, structural adjustment lending by the World Bank and IMF, and domestic mismanagement. African countries owed an estimated $300 billion, and many were spending more on debt service than on health and education combined.\n\nThe debt crisis had become a major obstacle to development. Resources that could have funded schools, clinics, and infrastructure were instead transferred to creditors in wealthy nations and multilateral institutions. Previous debt relief mechanisms, including the Toronto Terms (1988), London Terms (1991), and Naples Terms (1994), provided partial relief on bilateral debt but did not address multilateral debt owed to the World Bank and IMF, which was considered sacrosanct.\n\nA global advocacy movement, catalyzed by the Jubilee 2000 campaign, mobilized millions of citizens in wealthy countries to demand comprehensive debt cancellation. The campaign drew moral force from the biblical concept of jubilee and the argument that much of the debt had been accumulated by undemocratic regimes without benefiting ordinary citizens.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative was launched in 1996 by the World Bank and IMF. It was the first comprehensive mechanism to address the debt of the poorest countries, including, for the first time, debt owed to multilateral institutions. To qualify, countries had to be eligible for IDA lending (the World Bank's concessional window), face unsustainable debt levels, and establish a track record of economic reform.\n\nThe Enhanced HIPC Initiative (1999) significantly expanded the framework, lowering the debt sustainability thresholds and linking relief to poverty reduction. Countries were required to develop Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) through participatory processes involving civil society. The process had two stages: at the decision point, countries committed to reform programs and began receiving interim relief; at the completion point, after demonstrating sustained performance, they received irrevocable debt stock reduction.\n\nThe Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), announced at the 2005 Gleneagles G8 Summit, went further by providing 100% cancellation of eligible debts owed to the IDA, the IMF, and the African Development Fund. This added approximately $42 billion in additional relief on top of HIPC commitments.\n\nBy 2023, 37 of 39 eligible countries had reached the completion point and received full HIPC debt relief. The two remaining pre-decision-point countries were Eritrea and Somalia (which reached its decision point in 2020).\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe HIPC and MDRI initiatives dramatically reduced debt burdens. External debt-to-GDP ratios in completion point countries fell from an average of 110% before HIPC to approximately 30% after MDRI. Debt service as a proportion of exports declined from 18% to below 5% in most beneficiary countries.\n\nChauvin and Kraay (2005), in a World Bank analysis, found that HIPC debt relief was associated with increased social spending in beneficiary countries. On average, spending on health, education, and social protection in HIPC countries increased from 6.4% to 9.5% of GDP between 2001 and 2012. Uganda, one of the first HIPC beneficiaries, used fiscal space from debt relief to eliminate primary school fees, resulting in a near-doubling of enrollment.\n\nThe PRSP process, despite its limitations, introduced participatory planning into economic policymaking in many countries for the first time. Civil society organizations gained a formal role in budgetary discussions, and poverty reduction became a stated policy priority.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nEasterly (2002) expressed skepticism about whether debt relief would produce sustained improvements. He argued that the same governance and policy weaknesses that had led to unsustainable borrowing in the first place would likely lead to re-accumulation of debt unless underlying institutional problems were addressed. He noted that many HIPC countries had received previous rounds of debt relief without lasting improvement.\n\nThis concern has proven partially prescient. By the late 2010s, many post-HIPC countries had accumulated significant new debt, much of it from non-traditional creditors including China and through commercial borrowing via Eurobond issuances. Ghana, Mozambique, and Zambia, all HIPC completion countries, subsequently experienced debt distress or default.\n\nThe conditionality attached to HIPC relief was criticized from multiple directions. Some argued that reform requirements were excessively burdensome and imposed inappropriate economic policies on poor countries. Others contended that the conditions were too lenient and failed to ensure genuine governance reform. The PRSP process, while participatory in design, was often formulaic in practice, with documents produced primarily to satisfy creditor requirements.\n\nMoral hazard was another concern: debt relief could incentivize future irresponsible borrowing by both debtor governments and creditors, creating expectations that debts would eventually be forgiven. The creditor moral hazard dimension, the responsibility of lenders who extended credit to clearly non-creditworthy governments, received insufficient attention.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Comprehensive debt relief can create fiscal space for social spending, but must be accompanied by reforms to prevent re-accumulation of unsustainable debt\n- Participatory poverty reduction planning (PRSPs) can improve policy processes but may become formulaic compliance exercises without genuine political commitment\n- Addressing multilateral debt, once considered taboo, proved essential for meaningful debt sustainability\n- Debt relief is most effective when combined with improved public financial management, domestic revenue mobilization, and responsible borrowing frameworks\n- Both debtor and creditor responsibility must be addressed to prevent recurring debt crises\n\n## References\n\n1.
