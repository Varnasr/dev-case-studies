  "content": "## Background\n\nNorthern Uganda endured one of Africa's longest and most brutal civil conflicts. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, waged an insurgency against the Ugandan government from 1986 to 2006, terrorizing civilian populations through mass abduction of children, mutilation, and forced displacement. At the conflict's peak in 2005, approximately 1.8 million people, the vast majority of the Acholi population, were confined to internally displaced persons (IDP) camps under dire conditions.\n\nThe conflict devastated northern Uganda's economy and social fabric. Decades of displacement meant that an entire generation grew up in camps with limited education, no agricultural experience on family land, and few economic opportunities. Youth unemployment and underemployment were pervasive, raising concerns about the potential for renewed instability as the conflict wound down following the 2006 Juba peace talks.\n\nThe Ugandan government, with World Bank financing, launched the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) in 2003 to support community recovery. NUSAF was designed as a community-driven development (CDD) programme, channeling resources to communities to identify and implement their own development priorities through local institutions.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nNUSAF I (2003–2009) was a $133 million programme covering 18 conflict-affected districts. It operated through three windows: community development initiatives (infrastructure, services), community reconciliation and conflict management, and a vulnerable groups support component. Communities formed project management committees to identify priorities and manage implementation.\n\nNUSAF II (2009–2015), funded at $100 million, built on the first phase but placed greater emphasis on livelihoods and household income generation. It included a Household Income Support component and continued community infrastructure investments. NUSAF III expanded the scope further with a focus on labour-intensive public works and livelihood support.\n\nThe most rigorously evaluated component of the NUSAF ecosystem was the Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP), which operated under NUSAF but was designed as a distinct intervention. YOP invited groups of young adults (aged 16–35) to submit proposals for vocational training and enterprise start-up. Successful groups received one-time unconditional cash grants averaging $382 per person (approximately $7,500 per group of 20). Recipients were free to use the funds for vocational training, tools, materials, or enterprise capital as they saw fit.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBlattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2014), published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, conducted a randomized controlled trial of the YOP, tracking 2,677 applicants (roughly half funded, half not) over four years. The results were striking. After four years, grant recipients had 41% higher earnings than the control group. They were 65% more likely to practice a skilled trade, had accumulated 57% more capital, and worked 17% more hours. The programme's rate of return was estimated at over 30% annually, making it one of the most cost-effective youth employment interventions ever evaluated.\n\nBlattman and Annan (2016) conducted complementary research on war-affected youth in northern Uganda, finding that economic reintegration programmes that provided capital and skills were more effective than psychosocial interventions alone in improving both economic outcomes and psychological well-being. Their work demonstrated that conflict-affected youth were rational economic actors capable of productive investment when given resources.\n\nThe broader NUSAF CDD components had more mixed results. A 2013 World Bank review noted that community sub-projects often suffered from weak maintenance, elite capture of resources, and limited sustainability. However, the programme was credited with channeling significant resources to a neglected region and building local institutional capacity during a critical post-conflict period.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nSeveral challenges limited NUSAF's impact. The CDD model assumed functional community institutions, but decades of displacement had severely disrupted social structures. Elite capture was a persistent concern, with better-connected individuals and groups disproportionately accessing resources. The quality and sustainability of community infrastructure projects varied widely.\n\nA longer-term follow-up of the YOP by Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2020) found that while positive effects on earnings and capital persisted after nine years, the magnitude of the treatment effect had diminished as control group members gradually caught up through their own enterprise development. This raised questions about whether the grants accelerated rather than fundamentally altered economic trajectories. The programme also primarily benefited men, as women faced greater barriers to enterprise development.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Unconditional cash grants to youth groups can generate substantial economic returns in post-conflict settings, challenging assumptions that the poor lack the capacity to invest productively.\n- Community-driven development in post-conflict settings requires careful attention to disrupted social structures and the risk of elite capture.\n- Rigorous impact evaluation, including long-term follow-up, is essential for understanding whether programme effects persist or fade over time.\n- Post-conflict economic recovery programmes should address gender-specific barriers to ensure equitable benefits.\n- Group-based grant models can facilitate peer monitoring and skill sharing while reducing administrative costs.\n\n## References\n\n- Blattman, C., Fiala, N., & Martinez, S.
