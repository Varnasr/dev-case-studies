  "content": "## Background\n\nJamaica's social protection landscape in the late 1990s was characterized by fragmented, poorly targeted programs with limited developmental impact. The existing Food Stamp Programme, established in the 1980s under structural adjustment, suffered from high leakage rates, with a significant proportion of benefits reaching non-poor households. Public assistance programs were uncoordinated, and poverty remained entrenched despite modest economic growth.\n\nIn this context, the Government of Jamaica, with World Bank technical and financial support, designed the Programme of Advancement Through Health and Education (PATH) as a consolidated conditional cash transfer program. PATH drew on the emerging evidence base from CCT programs in Latin America, particularly Mexico's Progresa/Oportunidades and Brazil's Bolsa Escola, adapting the model to Jamaica's Caribbean context.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nPATH was launched in 2001, consolidating three existing welfare programs—the Food Stamp Programme, the Outdoor Poor Relief Programme, and the Public Assistance Programme—into a single conditional cash transfer. The program targets four vulnerable groups: children aged 0–17, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly poor, and persons with disabilities.\n\nTargeting is conducted through the Beneficiary Identification System (BIS), a proxy means-testing tool that assigns households a welfare score based on demographic characteristics, asset ownership, housing conditions, and geographic location. Households scoring below the poverty threshold are eligible for PATH benefits.\n\nFor children, transfers are conditional on school attendance (minimum 85% of school days) and regular health check-ups (children 0–6 must attend health clinics for growth monitoring and immunization). Transfers for the elderly and disabled are unconditional. The transfer amount has been periodically adjusted, reaching approximately J$2,200 (about US$14) per month per child by the late 2010s, with higher amounts for secondary students to address the higher opportunity costs of continued education.\n\nCompliance is monitored through schools and health facilities, which report attendance to the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. Non-compliant households receive warnings and may face temporary suspension of benefits.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nLevy and Ohls (2007) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of PATH's first years using a quasi-experimental design. They found that PATH increased school attendance by approximately 0.5 days per month among beneficiary children, with larger effects for boys and for secondary school students. Health visit compliance increased significantly among children aged 0–6, particularly for growth monitoring visits.\n\nThe evaluation also found that PATH reduced child labor, with beneficiary children spending less time on income-generating activities. Household food consumption increased modestly, and there was evidence of improved dietary diversity among beneficiary families.\n\nThe World Bank's Implementation Completion Report (2012) assessed PATH favorably on targeting and administrative efficiency. The BIS was found to correctly identify 60% of the poor in the lowest two quintiles—an improvement over the previous food stamp system's targeting performance, though still leaving room for improvement.\n\nMoreno et al. (2017) examined PATH's longer-term effects, finding sustained attendance improvements and noting that the program had become an integral part of Jamaica's social protection system, surviving changes in government and economic downturns.\n\nHowever, effects on educational achievement—as opposed to attendance—were less clear. Test score improvements were not consistently demonstrated, suggesting that attendance gains did not automatically translate into learning improvements without complementary supply-side investments.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe transfer amount has been criticized as insufficient to meaningfully affect household welfare. At approximately US$14 per month per child, the transfer covers only a fraction of schooling costs and household needs. Inflation has eroded the real value of transfers between adjustment periods.\n\nConditionality monitoring faces practical challenges. Schools and health facilities do not always submit compliance reports consistently, weakening the enforcement mechanism. In rural and underserved areas, supply-side constraints—lack of school places, distant health facilities—make compliance difficult even for willing beneficiaries.\n\nThe BIS targeting system, while an improvement, still suffers from exclusion errors, leaving some genuinely poor households without support. Updating beneficiary records and removing households that have graduated from poverty have been ongoing administrative challenges.\n\nJamaica's high debt burden (debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 100% for much of PATH's existence) has constrained the fiscal space for social protection, limiting the program's expansion and benefit levels.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- CCT programs can be successfully adapted to Caribbean small island developing states, though design must account for smaller populations and more limited administrative capacity\n- Consolidating fragmented welfare programs into a single transfer system improves administrative efficiency and targeting\n- Attendance gains from CCTs do not automatically translate into learning improvements—complementary investments in educational quality are essential\n- Proxy means-testing provides a workable targeting mechanism in contexts where income data is unreliable, but requires regular updating\n- Sustained World Bank support over multiple project phases enabled institutional learning and program evolution\n\n## References\n\n1.
