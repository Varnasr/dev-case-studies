  "content": "## Background\n\nApartheid's spatial legacy left South Africa with one of the most unequal urban landscapes in the world. Decades of forced removals, Group Areas legislation, and deliberate underdevelopment of Black residential areas created vast townships on the urban periphery, far from economic opportunities, while informal settlements proliferated as urbanization accelerated under and after apartheid. By 1994, South Africa faced a housing backlog estimated at 1.5 million units, with millions more living in inadequate conditions.\n\nThe Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), the ANC's flagship policy platform during the 1994 transition, identified housing as a basic right and committed the new government to delivering housing at scale. Section 26 of the new Constitution enshrined the right to adequate housing, obligating the state to take reasonable measures to progressively realize this right.\n\nThe housing crisis was not merely a matter of shelter. Under apartheid, residential location determined access to jobs, services, education, and social networks. Addressing the housing deficit was therefore seen as essential to dismantling the spatial and economic architecture of racial inequality.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe post-apartheid housing programme, commonly known as \"RDP housing,\" provided fully subsidized houses to qualifying low-income households earning below a specified income threshold (initially R3,500 per month). The programme used a capital subsidy model in which the government provided funding, private developers built the houses, and beneficiaries received full ownership at no cost.\n\nThe typical RDP house was a basic structure of 30-40 square metres on a serviced site with water, sanitation, and electricity connections. The programme operated at enormous scale: between 1994 and 2020, over 4.5 million housing units and serviced sites were delivered, sheltering an estimated 20 million people. This represented the largest government-funded housing programme anywhere in the Global South.\n\nIn 2004, the government adopted the \"Breaking New Ground\" (BNG) policy, which acknowledged the shortcomings of the initial RDP approach and called for a shift toward creating sustainable human settlements rather than merely delivering houses. BNG emphasized higher quality construction, better-located developments, mixed-income communities, and upgrading of informal settlements in situ rather than relocation.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe scale of delivery is undeniable and represents a significant achievement in the context of post-apartheid reconstruction. Millions of South Africans who previously lived in shacks, backyard dwellings, or overcrowded conditions received formal housing with secure tenure and basic services for the first time. Asset ownership through housing has been documented as having positive effects on household wealth and economic security.\n\nHowever, research has identified serious problems with the programme. Huchzermeyer (2001), writing in *International Planning Studies*, argued that the capital subsidy model incentivized quantity over quality and reinforced peripheral development by making it cheaper for developers to build on inexpensive land far from city centres. This meant that many RDP developments perpetuated rather than dismantled apartheid spatial patterns, trapping beneficiaries in distant locations with poor access to jobs and services.\n\nTomlinson (2006) documented widespread construction quality problems, including cracking walls, leaking roofs, and inadequate foundations, particularly in houses built during the early years of the programme. The National Home Builders Registration Council identified tens of thousands of defective units requiring rectification. The spatial mismatch between housing locations and employment centres imposed heavy transportation costs on residents, undermining the poverty-reduction benefits of free housing.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite delivering over 4.5 million units, the housing backlog has continued to grow, reaching an estimated 2.3 million units by 2020, as new household formation outpaced delivery. The programme's focus on new greenfield development has been criticized for neglecting informal settlement upgrading, rental housing, and inner-city accommodation. Many beneficiaries sold or rented out their RDP houses and returned to informal settlements closer to employment, revealing the limits of a supply-driven, peripheral housing model.\n\nThe Breaking New Ground policy aspiration for well-located, mixed-income settlements has been difficult to implement in practice, as land costs in central areas are prohibitive and political pressures favour visible unit delivery. Corruption in housing allocation and construction contracts has been widespread, with the Special Investigating Unit identifying billions of rands in irregular expenditure. The programme thus embodies a central tension: it has delivered an enormous amount of housing but has been less successful at creating the integrated, equitable urban spaces needed to overcome apartheid's legacy.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Mass housing delivery through capital subsidies can achieve impressive scale but risks prioritizing quantity over quality and location.\n- Housing location is as important as housing quality; peripheral developments can entrench rather than reduce spatial inequality and poverty.\n- The gap between policy aspiration (Breaking New Ground's sustainable human settlements) and implementation reality (continued peripheral development) reflects deeper political economy constraints.\n- Informal settlement upgrading and incremental housing approaches may be more effective than greenfield development for addressing the needs of the urban poor.\n- Secure tenure and basic services matter as much as formal housing structures; a broader conception of housing adequacy is needed.\n\n## References\n\n- Huchzermeyer, M.
