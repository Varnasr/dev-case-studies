  "content": "## Background\n\nEcuador's 1999 banking crisis was one of the most severe financial collapses in Latin American history. A combination of factors—the 1997–1998 El Niño floods, the 1998 drop in oil prices, the contagion from the Asian and Russian financial crises, and the border war with Peru—overwhelmed an already fragile banking system. By mid-1999, sixteen of the country's forty banks had failed or been taken over by the state.\n\nThe government of President Jamil Mahuad imposed a deposit freeze in March 1999, trapping approximately US$3.8 billion in savings. GDP contracted by 4.7%, and the sucre lost over 60% of its value against the dollar. Inflation surged to 96% in 2000. Poverty rates nearly doubled, rising from 34% in 1995 to 56% in 1999. An estimated 600,000 Ecuadorians emigrated between 1999 and 2004, primarily to Spain and the United States.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nOn January 9, 2000, President Mahuad announced the adoption of the US dollar as Ecuador's official currency at an exchange rate of 25,000 sucres per dollar. The decision was taken as a last resort to halt hyperinflationary pressures and restore confidence in the financial system. Just two weeks later, Mahuad was ousted in a military-indigenous uprising, but his successor, Gustavo Noboa, proceeded with the dollarization plan.\n\nThe Ley de Transformación Económica del Ecuador (Trole I) was passed in March 2000, providing the legal framework for dollarization. The Central Bank of Ecuador retained limited functions—it could no longer print money or serve as lender of last resort but continued to manage liquidity reserves and oversee the payment system.\n\nThe conversion process was completed by September 2000. All sucre-denominated accounts, contracts, and prices were converted to dollars. Ecuador's coins (centavos) were minted in the same denominations and sizes as US coins.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBeckerman and Solimano (2002) provided an early assessment, noting that dollarization succeeded in its primary objective of stabilizing prices. Inflation fell from 96% in 2000 to 12.5% in 2001 and further to 7.9% in 2002, eventually stabilizing at 2–3% per year. Price stability reduced uncertainty and encouraged longer-term economic planning.\n\nGDP growth recovered strongly, averaging 4.9% from 2000 to 2008, driven by high oil prices and remittance inflows. Dollarization eliminated currency risk for remittances, which grew from US$1.1 billion in 2000 to US$2.8 billion by 2007, becoming a crucial source of foreign exchange.\n\nJameson (2003) argued that while dollarization addressed the immediate crisis, it imposed significant structural costs. Without monetary policy, Ecuador could not adjust interest rates or exchange rates in response to external shocks. When oil prices collapsed in 2008–2009 and again in 2014–2016, the government lacked tools to cushion the impact, leading to fiscal austerity and rising debt.\n\nThe loss of the exchange rate adjustment mechanism also affected competitiveness. Neighboring Colombia's peso depreciated significantly at various points, making Colombian goods cheaper relative to Ecuadorian products. This real exchange rate appreciation harmed non-oil exports and agriculture.\n\nBeckerman (2002) also highlighted that dollarization deepened Ecuador's dependence on oil exports, which represented approximately 50% of export revenues and 30% of fiscal income. Any decline in oil prices directly translated into fiscal and balance-of-payments crises.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe loss of monetary policy independence remains the most significant structural challenge. Ecuador cannot devalue to restore competitiveness or use quantitative easing during recessions. The Central Bank cannot act as lender of last resort, making the banking system more vulnerable to liquidity crises.\n\nThe arrangement has also constrained fiscal policy. Without the ability to monetize deficits, the government must either borrow externally or cut spending during downturns, creating procyclical fiscal dynamics. Under President Correa (2007–2017), Ecuador relied heavily on Chinese lending and oil-backed loans to finance counter-cyclical spending.\n\nDe-dollarization has been periodically debated but remains politically infeasible. Surveys consistently show that a majority of Ecuadorians support maintaining the dollar, viewing it as a bulwark against the inflationary episodes of the past. This creates a form of institutional lock-in.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Dollarization can be an effective emergency stabilization tool when monetary credibility has been completely lost\n- The elimination of inflation risk comes at the cost of permanently surrendering monetary policy and exchange rate flexibility\n- Dollarization facilitates remittance flows by eliminating currency conversion costs and exchange rate risk\n- Resource-dependent economies face amplified vulnerability under dollarization, as commodity price swings cannot be cushioned by exchange rate adjustments\n- Political economy dynamics can make dollarization effectively irreversible even when economic conditions change\n\n## References\n\n1.
