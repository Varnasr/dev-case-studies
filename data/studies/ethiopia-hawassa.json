  "content": "## Background\n\nEthiopia's Growth and Transformation Plans envisioned transforming the country from an agriculture-dependent economy to a manufacturing hub, particularly in light manufacturing sectors like textiles and garments. The model drew explicit inspiration from China's export-processing zones and the broader East Asian industrialization experience. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his successor Hailemariam Desalegn saw industrial parks as the vehicle for this transformation, offering infrastructure, tax incentives, and cheap labor to attract foreign direct investment.\n\nThe rationale was grounded in Ethiopia's comparative advantages: a large, young, low-cost labor force (with wages approximately one-quarter of those in China and lower than Bangladesh); growing infrastructure including the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway; preferential trade access to the US (through the African Growth and Opportunity Act) and Europe (through the Everything But Arms arrangement); and a stable, if authoritarian, political environment. Arkebe Oqubay, a senior government advisor, articulated the industrial strategy in his influential 2015 book *Made in Africa*, which analyzed Ethiopia's approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe garment and textile sector was identified as the entry point, following the path of countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Global brands were actively seeking alternatives to concentrated production in Asia, creating an opportunity window. However, Ethiopia had virtually no garment export industry before 2010, requiring the entire value chain—from training to logistics to supplier networks—to be built essentially from scratch.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Hawassa Industrial Park (HIP), inaugurated in July 2016, was the flagship of Ethiopia's industrial park strategy. Built by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) in just nine months, the 130-hectare park included 52 factory sheds, a zero-liquid-discharge effluent treatment plant, a one-stop-shop government services center, and worker amenities. The development was financed entirely by the Ethiopian government through borrowing, at a cost of approximately $250 million.\n\nPVH Corporation, the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, served as the anchor tenant, committing to sourcing from the park. Other investors included companies from India, China, Sri Lanka, and other Asian garment-producing countries. The Ethiopian Investment Commission offered an incentive package that included tax holidays of up to 10 years, duty-free importation of machinery and raw materials, subsidized factory rents, and one-stop-shop administrative services.\n\nHawassa was part of a broader national strategy that planned 13 industrial parks across the country, several of which became operational between 2017 and 2020, including Bole Lemi (Addis Ababa), Kombolcha, Mekelle, Adama, and Jimma. The Ethiopian Industrial Parks Development Corporation (IPDC) was established as the dedicated state entity responsible for developing and managing the parks. The approach represented a significant public bet on manufacturing-led structural transformation, requiring large upfront investment with returns dependent on sustained investor confidence and export growth.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBy 2019, Hawassa employed approximately 30,000 workers—well short of the 60,000 target—and was exporting garments valued at approximately $50 million annually. While this represented significant growth from a near-zero base, it fell far short of the government's ambitious targets. Ethiopia's total garment and textile exports remained below $200 million annually, compared to Bangladesh's $34 billion.\n\nResearch by Blattman and Dercon (2018), based on a randomized experiment in Ethiopian factories (including facilities near Addis Ababa), produced sobering findings published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*. They found that while factory jobs offered wages above the alternative of subsistence agriculture, the work conditions were harsh, turnover rates were extremely high (approaching 100% annually in many factories), and many workers returned to informal sector activities within a year. The study challenged the assumption that manufacturing jobs represented a straightforward improvement for the poor.\n\nHardy and McCasland (2023) further documented challenges in Ethiopian factories, finding that productivity remained significantly below Asian comparators. The combination of low wages (approximately $40-50 per month, among the lowest in any garment-producing country), unfamiliar industrial work discipline, and limited support services (housing, transport, childcare) for workers—many of whom migrated from rural areas—created persistent labor challenges.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe wage issue became internationally contentious. Reports by the Worker Rights Consortium and other labor organizations documented that wages at Hawassa and other Ethiopian industrial parks were insufficient to meet basic needs, with workers struggling to afford food and housing. The New York Times and other media outlets published investigative reports highlighting that Ethiopia's ultra-low wages—the lowest of any garment-exporting country—were not a sign of competitiveness but of worker exploitation. Some brands, including PVH, subsequently reduced their sourcing from Ethiopia.\n\nThe civil conflict that began in Tigray in November 2020 and spread to parts of Amhara and Afar severely disrupted the industrial park program. The Mekelle Industrial Park, in Tigray's capital, was rendered inoperable. Supply chains were disrupted, investor confidence plummeted, and the US suspended Ethiopia from AGOA eligibility in January 2022, eliminating a key trade preference that had attracted investment. Logistics challenges, including inefficiencies at the Djibouti port and unreliable electricity supply, compounded the difficulties. By 2022, several industrial parks were operating well below capacity, and the vision of Ethiopia as Africa's manufacturing hub appeared considerably more distant than it had in 2016.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Industrial parks require more than infrastructure**: While Ethiopia built impressive physical facilities, the complementary ecosystem—skilled labor, efficient logistics, reliable utilities, and adequate worker welfare—proved equally or more important.\n- **Ultra-low wages are not a sustainable competitive advantage**: Wages below subsistence levels generate high turnover, low productivity, reputational risk, and potential loss of trade preferences, undermining the very competitiveness they are intended to create.\n- **Political stability is a prerequisite for manufacturing FDI**: The Tigray conflict demonstrated how quickly political instability can destroy years of investment in industrial development.\n- **Graduation from trade preferences requires building genuine competitiveness**: Dependence on preferential access (AGOA, EBA) creates vulnerability to political decisions in importing countries.\n- **Worker welfare and industrial policy must be integrated**: Transportation, housing, childcare, and living wages for workers are not social luxuries but essential components of a functioning industrial strategy.\n\n## References\n\n- Oqubay, A.
