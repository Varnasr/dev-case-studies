  "content": "## Background\n\nGuatemala faces some of the most severe poverty and inequality indicators in Latin America. Chronic malnutrition affects approximately 47% of children under five—the highest rate in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth highest globally. Poverty is concentrated among the indigenous Maya population, who comprise roughly 40% of the country's population but account for a disproportionate share of the poor. Indigenous children are significantly less likely to complete primary school and more likely to suffer malnutrition.\n\nDespite these conditions, Guatemala was a latecomer to the conditional cash transfer movement that swept Latin America in the 2000s. The country's political economy—characterized by powerful economic elites resistant to redistributive taxation, weak state institutions, and historically low social spending—created an unfavorable environment for social protection programs.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nMi Familia Progresa (MIFAPRO) was launched in 2008 under President Álvaro Colom, Guatemala's first center-left president in decades. The program provided monthly cash transfers of Q300 (approximately US$39) to poor families in the most marginalized rural municipalities, conditional on children's school enrollment and attendance and regular health check-ups.\n\nThe program was housed under the Consejo de Cohesión Social, a presidential-level body chaired by the First Lady, Sandra Torres. This institutional placement—outside the regular ministerial structure—was intended to expedite implementation but raised concerns about institutional sustainability and politicization.\n\nMIFAPRO expanded rapidly, reaching 800,000 families by 2010 across 307 of Guatemala's 333 municipalities. The geographic targeting prioritized municipalities with the highest poverty rates and largest indigenous populations. Within targeted municipalities, community-level selection identified the poorest households.\n\nThe program included education and health conditionalities. Children aged 6–15 were required to maintain 80% school attendance, and children under six and pregnant women were required to attend regular health appointments. Transfers were paid to mothers, consistent with evidence from other CCT programs that female-directed transfers improve child welfare outcomes.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nCecchini and Madariaga (2011), in their comprehensive review of Latin American CCTs for ECLAC, found limited rigorous impact evidence for MIFAPRO. The program's rapid expansion without a built-in evaluation design made causal attribution difficult. Available data suggested modest improvements in school enrollment in program areas, but the absence of a credible comparison group weakened the evidence.\n\nAdministrative data indicated increases in health facility visits in program municipalities, though supply-side constraints—particularly the severe shortage of health facilities and personnel in rural indigenous areas—limited the practical impact of the health conditionality.\n\nMolina (2012) provided a critical institutional analysis, documenting how the program's placement under the Consejo de Cohesión Social facilitated political manipulation. The rapid expansion before the 2011 elections, combined with the First Lady's prominent role in program delivery, fueled allegations that MIFAPRO was being used as a political patronage tool. Sandra Torres subsequently sought the presidency, though her candidacy was blocked by a constitutional provision preventing close relatives of the incumbent from running.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank's assessment noted that while the program reached a large share of the target population, institutional weakness undermined effectiveness. Compliance monitoring was inadequate, the management information system was rudimentary, and the targeting mechanism suffered from inclusion and exclusion errors.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nPoliticization was the program's most damaging challenge. The concentration of authority in the presidential office and the First Lady's direct involvement blurred the line between social policy and political campaigning. This pattern has been common in Guatemala, where social programs often do not survive changes in government.\n\nWhen President Otto Pérez Molina took office in 2012, MIFAPRO was discontinued and replaced by Mi Bono Seguro, which in turn was replaced by subsequent administrations. This cycle of program creation and destruction with each presidential term has prevented the institutional learning and consolidation that characterize successful CCT programs in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia.\n\nSupply-side constraints fundamentally limited the program's potential impact. In many targeted municipalities, schools were overcrowded or distant, and health facilities were severely understaffed. Requiring families to attend services that barely existed was problematic. Guatemala's health spending of approximately 2% of GDP was among the lowest in the region.\n\nThe institutional context also created accountability gaps. Without an independent evaluation agency or robust civil society monitoring, there was limited oversight of program implementation and resource use.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Institutional placement matters: housing CCTs in presidential offices rather than line ministries creates vulnerability to political capture and discontinuity across administrations\n- Rapid program expansion without built-in evaluation designs forfeits the opportunity to generate rigorous evidence of impact\n- Supply-side constraints in health and education limit the effectiveness of demand-side conditionalities—complementary investments in service delivery are essential\n- Political continuity of social programs requires institutionalization through legislation and independent administrative structures rather than presidential decree\n- Reaching indigenous populations requires culturally appropriate outreach and delivery mechanisms\n\n## References\n\n1.
