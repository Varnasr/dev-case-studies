  "content": "## Background\n\nThe hukou (household registration) system was formally established in 1958 through the Regulations on Household Registration of the People's Republic of China. Drawing on earlier population management practices, the system classified every citizen as either \"agricultural\" (rural) or \"non-agricultural\" (urban) and tied this classification to a specific locality. Movement from rural to urban areas without official permission was effectively prohibited, enforced through the rationing system that made access to food, housing, education, and healthcare contingent on local registration.\n\nDuring the Mao era (1949-1976), the hukou system served as a cornerstone of the planned economy, preventing rural-to-urban migration and enabling the state to extract agricultural surplus to finance industrialization. The system created a rigid dual society: urban residents received comprehensive welfare provisions through work units (danwei), while rural populations were largely self-reliant through collective agriculture. Chan (2019) describes this as one of the most comprehensive systems of internal migration control in modern history.\n\nWith economic reforms from 1978 onward, the practical enforcement of migration restrictions gradually eroded. As factories in coastal cities demanded labor, tens of millions of rural residents migrated to cities to work in manufacturing, construction, and services. However, they did so without converting their hukou, creating a vast population of urban residents who lacked formal entitlements to the cities where they lived and worked.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nReform of the hukou system has been incremental rather than revolutionary, reflecting tensions between the economic need for labor mobility and concerns about urban fiscal capacity, social stability, and the political interests of existing urban residents. The reform trajectory has involved several phases.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, temporary residence permits were introduced, allowing migrants to live and work in cities legally while maintaining their rural registration. Small towns and cities began loosening conversion requirements. In 2001, the State Council issued guidelines allowing small cities and towns to grant local hukou to migrants meeting certain conditions, including stable employment and housing.\n\nMore substantive reforms came in 2014 with the National New-Type Urbanization Plan, which established a tiered system: small cities would fully liberalize hukou conversion, medium-sized cities would relax restrictions, and large cities would maintain points-based systems. Cities with populations under 3 million were directed to remove most restrictions by 2020. However, the largest and most desirable cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, maintained strict quotas, with points-based systems that heavily favored educated and wealthy applicants.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe partial reforms have facilitated massive urbanization. China's urban population grew from 18% in 1978 to 64.7% in 2021. However, a significant gap persists between de facto urbanization (people living in cities) and hukou-based urbanization (people with urban registration): approximately 64.7% versus 45.4% in 2021, representing roughly 290 million people living in cities without full urban entitlements.\n\nLu and Zhou (2013) documented the substantial consequences of hukou-based exclusion. Migrant workers without local hukou face barriers accessing public education for their children, subsidized healthcare, public housing, unemployment insurance, and pension systems. Their research found that hukou status was a significant determinant of subjective well-being among urban residents, even after controlling for income differences.\n\nThe effects on children are particularly well-documented. An estimated 35 million \"left-behind children\" remain in rural areas while their parents work in cities, unable to access urban schools. Studies by Lu and Zhou (2013) and others have found negative impacts on educational outcomes, psychological well-being, and health for these children. Migrant children who do accompany their parents to cities often attend inferior private schools, as public school enrollment requires local hukou.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fundamental challenge is fiscal: extending full urban services to hundreds of millions of migrants would impose enormous costs on city governments, which are already heavily indebted. The National Development and Reform Commission estimated that full urbanization of existing migrants would cost approximately 100,000 yuan per person. Cities have little fiscal incentive to absorb migrants, as the current system allows them to benefit from migrant labor while externalizing the costs of social reproduction to rural areas.\n\nChan (2019) argues that the hukou system perpetuates a form of institutionalized inequality comparable to apartheid in its functional effects, creating a two-tier citizenship within cities. Reform proposals face political opposition from urban residents who view hukou restrictions as protecting their access to public services and property values. The system also serves state interests in maintaining social control and managing urbanization at a politically manageable pace.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Institutional legacies from the planned economy era can persist and create new forms of inequality even as economic liberalization proceeds.\n- Incremental reform of exclusionary systems can facilitate economic growth while perpetuating social injustice for the most vulnerable populations.\n- Labor mobility restrictions create significant welfare losses not only for migrants but for the national economy through misallocation of human capital.\n- Fiscal decentralization without adequate intergovernmental transfers creates structural barriers to inclusive urbanization.\n- Children's welfare must be central to migration policy design, as the costs of family separation are severe and long-lasting.\n\n## References\n\n- Chan, K.
