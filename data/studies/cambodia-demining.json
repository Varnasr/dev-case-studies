  "content": "## Background\n\nCambodia is one of the most landmine-contaminated countries in the world, a legacy of over three decades of conflict including the Vietnam War-era US bombing campaign (1965–1973), the Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1979), the Vietnamese occupation (1979–1989), and continued civil conflict through the 1990s. An estimated 4 to 6 million landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) were scattered across the country, concentrated in the western and northwestern provinces along the Thai border, where frontline fighting between Khmer Rouge forces and government troops continued into the late 1990s.\n\nThe human toll has been devastating. Between 1979 and 2022, approximately 65,000 Cambodians were killed or injured by mines and UXO. At the peak in 1996, casualties reached 4,320 per year—an average of nearly 12 people per day. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita rates of amputees in the world, with approximately 40,000 mine survivors living with limb loss. The contamination disproportionately affected rural populations, as mines were concentrated in agricultural areas, forests, and along pathways, making farming, foraging, and movement dangerous.\n\nBeyond direct casualties, mine contamination impeded development by rendering productive agricultural land unusable, deterring investment in rural infrastructure, and constraining post-conflict economic recovery. Bottomley (2003) estimated that mine contamination blocked access to significant amounts of potentially productive farmland, constraining livelihood options for some of the country's poorest communities in already disadvantaged provinces.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nOrganized mine clearance began in 1992 with the establishment of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC), initially supported by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). CMAC became the primary national demining operator, eventually employing over 2,000 deminers. International organizations including the HALO Trust (operating in Cambodia since 1991), Mines Advisory Group (MAG), and Norwegian People's Aid supplemented national capacity.\n\nThe Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA), established in 2000, coordinated national mine action strategy, set priorities for clearance, and regulated operators. The strategic framework prioritized clearance of areas with the highest developmental impact—land needed for agriculture, infrastructure, and community expansion—rather than attempting systematic clearance of all contaminated areas, many of which were in remote forests with low developmental value.\n\nMethods evolved significantly over three decades. Early clearance relied heavily on manual demining, which was safe but extremely slow and costly at approximately $1 per square meter. The introduction of mine detection dogs, mechanical clearance equipment (flails and tillers), and more recently ground-penetrating radar improved efficiency. Land Release methodology, adopted from 2009, used non-technical survey, technical survey, and clearance in sequence, enabling large areas to be released as mine-free without full clearance where evidence indicated low contamination risk.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe reduction in casualties has been dramatic. From the peak of 4,320 in 1996, annual mine and UXO casualties fell to 286 in 2010, 111 in 2019, and 77 in 2022. This 98% reduction reflects the combined effect of clearance, risk education programs reaching millions of Cambodians, and behavioral adaptation by communities living in contaminated areas. The casualty profile shifted from primarily mine victims to primarily UXO victims, as people increasingly encounter explosive remnants while digging, farming, or handling ordnance for scrap metal.\n\nBy 2022, CMAC and its partners had cleared over 2,576 square kilometers of land and destroyed over 1.1 million antipersonnel mines, 26,000 anti-tank mines, and over 3 million items of UXO. Cleared land has been converted primarily to agriculture—rice paddies, cassava fields, and rubber plantations—directly supporting rural livelihoods. Studies by the Landmine Monitor and CMAC have documented that cleared land increases agricultural productivity and household incomes in affected communities.\n\nHowever, the task remains enormous. An estimated 1,968 square kilometers remain contaminated as of 2022. Cambodia has committed to the Ottawa Treaty goal of complete mine clearance by 2025, but this deadline has been extended as the remaining contamination is in increasingly difficult terrain. International funding for mine action has declined from its peak, even as clearance of the remaining areas becomes more technically challenging and expensive per square meter.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nFunding sustainability is a major concern. International donors have provided the bulk of mine action financing, but funding has declined as other humanitarian crises compete for attention and as Cambodia's economic growth raises questions about its continued eligibility for aid. The Cambodian government's domestic contribution to mine action has increased but remains modest relative to the overall budget.\n\nThe land released through clearance has not always benefited the poorest communities. Reports by human rights organizations have documented cases where cleared land was allocated to politically connected individuals or companies rather than to mine-affected communities. Governance of post-clearance land allocation remains a challenge. Victim assistance has also been criticized as inadequate, with many of Cambodia's 40,000 mine survivors lacking access to prosthetics, rehabilitation, and economic reintegration support. The comparison with Lao PDR, where UXO contamination from US bombing is arguably more extensive but has received less international attention, highlights the role of political factors and advocacy in shaping mine action funding.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Sustained mine clearance investment over decades can achieve dramatic reductions in casualties and release land for productive use, but complete clearance requires long-term commitment beyond typical donor funding cycles.\n- Land Release methodology, which prioritizes survey over clearance, can dramatically improve efficiency by allowing release of low-risk areas without full clearance.\n- Risk education programs complement physical clearance and contribute to casualty reduction, particularly in communities where clearance has not yet reached.\n- Post-clearance land governance is as important as clearance itself; without equitable allocation mechanisms, the development benefits may not reach mine-affected communities.\n- International mine action frameworks (Ottawa Treaty, Landmine Monitor) provide accountability mechanisms but compliance depends on sustained political will and adequate resources.\n\n## References\n\n- Bottomley, R.
