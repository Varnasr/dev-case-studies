  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the early 2000s, Turkey faced significant educational disparities. While primary enrollment was near-universal, secondary school enrollment lagged, particularly for girls in rural eastern provinces. In 2002, the net secondary enrollment rate for girls in eastern Turkey was approximately 25-30%, compared to over 70% in western provinces. Poverty was a primary barrier: poor families needed children's labor and could not afford transportation, supplies, and opportunity costs. Cultural factors, particularly in conservative regions, further discouraged girls' continued education.\n\nThe 2001 economic crisis deepened poverty, with nearly 27% of the population below the poverty line. Turkey's social protection system was fragmented across multiple institutions with overlapping mandates and limited coverage of the poorest. The Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundation (SYDTF), established in 1986, provided discretionary assistance but lacked systematic targeting or conditional design.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme was launched in 2003 as part of the World Bank-supported Social Risk Mitigation Project. The programme provides monthly payments to poor families conditional on children's regular school attendance (minimum 80%) and health check-ups. A crucial design feature is the gender differential: payments for girls are approximately 25% higher than for boys at every level, and secondary school payments are higher than primary, creating the strongest incentive for girls' secondary enrollment, the target behaviour.\n\nTransfer amounts were set to cover approximately the direct costs of schooling (transportation, supplies, clothing). By 2010, monthly payments ranged from approximately TL 35 for a primary-school boy to TL 55 for a secondary-school girl. Payments are made to mothers, based on evidence from Latin American CCT programmes that maternal control of resources improves children's outcomes.\n\nEligibility is determined through means testing, with the programme targeting the poorest 6% of the population. The Integrated Social Assistance Information System (ISAIS) was developed to verify income, cross-checking applicant information against tax records, property registries, vehicle registration, and other administrative databases. This social registry grew to cover approximately 36 million individuals, becoming the backbone of Turkey's social assistance system.\n\nThe programme was administered by the General Directorate of Social Assistance (GDSA, formerly SHCEK/SYDGM), which coordinated with the Ministry of National Education for attendance verification and the Ministry of Health for health conditionality monitoring.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nAhmed et al. (2007), in a World Bank evaluation, found significant positive effects on enrollment, particularly for girls. Girls' secondary school enrollment increased by approximately 10 percentage points in programme areas compared to control groups. The gender-differentiated payment structure was credited with narrowing the gender gap in education, as families responded to the higher financial incentive for girls.\n\nAdato et al. (2014) conducted a qualitative evaluation documenting how the programme changed household decision-making dynamics. Mothers reported greater influence over educational decisions, and the programme reduced the practice of withdrawing girls from school for early marriage or household labor. However, the researchers noted that supply-side constraints, including school quality, distance, and teacher shortages in rural areas, limited the programme's ability to translate enrollment into learning outcomes.\n\nOverall secondary enrollment in Turkey rose from 51% in 2000 to 79% by 2012, driven by a combination of the CCT, compulsory education law extension (from 8 to 12 years in 2012), and school construction programmes. Disaggregating the specific contribution of the CCT is methodologically challenging, but Ahmed et al. (2007) attributed a substantial share of the girls' enrollment gains to the transfer programme.\n\nThe social registry developed for the CCT became Turkey's primary targeting tool for all social assistance programmes, including disability benefits, housing assistance, and emergency support. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the registry enabled rapid identification and payment to 2.1 million additional vulnerable households.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nTransfer values did not keep pace with inflation, reducing real purchasing power over time. The means-testing threshold was strict (bottom 6%), excluding many near-poor families who also struggled with education costs. Families just above the eligibility threshold received nothing, creating cliff effects and resentment.\n\nConditionality monitoring was uneven. Attendance records were sometimes unreliable, particularly in rural areas, and enforcement of the 80% attendance requirement was inconsistent. Health conditionality monitoring was even weaker, with limited coordination between social assistance and health systems.\n\nThe programme did not adequately address supply-side barriers. In many poor, rural areas, schools were distant, overcrowded, or poorly resourced. Teachers in eastern provinces often lacked motivation and were seeking transfers to western cities. The quality of education received by CCT beneficiaries was often poor, meaning that enrollment gains did not necessarily translate into human capital gains.\n\nThe 2016 expansion of the programme to cover Syrian refugee children (through the EU-funded CCTE programme for approximately 700,000 children) was a significant adaptation, demonstrating the programme's scalability for emergency contexts.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Gender-differentiated payment rates can effectively close enrollment gaps by making girls' education economically rational for poor families\n- Paying mothers rather than fathers aligns with evidence on intra-household resource allocation and women's empowerment\n- Conditional cash transfers must be complemented by supply-side investments in school quality, teacher capacity, and physical access\n- Social registries developed for CCTs can become platform infrastructure for a country's entire social protection system\n- Means-testing thresholds must be carefully designed to avoid excluding near-poor populations and creating resentment\n- CCT programme infrastructure can be adapted for emergency and refugee contexts, as demonstrated by the CCTE for Syrians\n\n## References\n\n1.
