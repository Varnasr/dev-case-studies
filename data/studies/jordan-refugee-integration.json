  "content": "## Background\n\nJordan, a resource-poor country of approximately 10 million people, experienced a massive influx of Syrian refugees following the outbreak of civil war in 2011. By 2016, UNHCR had registered over 650,000 Syrian refugees, though the Jordanian government estimated the total Syrian population at 1.3 million, including those who had arrived before the conflict. This made Jordan one of the largest refugee-hosting countries per capita in the world.\n\nThe refugee influx placed enormous strain on Jordan's already stretched public services, water supply, housing, and labor market. Jordan's economy was growing slowly, with high unemployment among Jordanians (approximately 15%) and chronic fiscal deficits. Historically, Jordan prohibited refugees from formal employment, pushing most Syrians into the informal economy where they faced exploitation and depressed wages for Jordanian workers.\n\nThe traditional humanitarian approach of indefinite camp-based assistance was increasingly seen as unsustainable and counterproductive, both for refugees and host communities.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Jordan Compact, agreed at the London Syria Conference in February 2016, represented a paradigm shift in refugee response. Drawing on the conceptual framework articulated by Betts and Collier, who argued that refugees should be treated as a development opportunity rather than purely a humanitarian burden, the Compact linked three elements: increased grant aid to Jordan, concessional loans from multilateral development banks, and preferential trade access to the EU in exchange for Jordan opening its labor market to Syrian refugees.\n\nSpecifically, the EU agreed to relax rules of origin requirements for Jordanian exports manufactured in 18 designated Special Economic Zones (SEZs), provided that Syrian refugees comprised at least 15% of the workforce (later raised to 25%). Jordan committed to issuing 200,000 work permits to Syrians in designated sectors including agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and food services.\n\nThe World Bank established the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), providing Jordan with $1.7 billion in concessional lending at interest rates well below market rates. This was the first time middle-income countries hosting refugees received IDA-equivalent financing terms.\n\nAlong with formal labor market access, the response included cash assistance programmes, education access (over 130,000 Syrian children enrolled in Jordanian public schools), and support for host community infrastructure.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBy 2022, Jordan had issued approximately 250,000 cumulative work permits to Syrians, though the number of active permits at any given time was lower due to non-renewal. Lenner and Turner (2019) conducted detailed research on the implementation of the Compact, finding that while the framework was innovative, uptake of work permits in SEZs was slower than expected. Many Syrians preferred informal work in urban areas to formal employment in remote SEZs offering low wages.\n\nThe EU trade concession had limited impact, with only a small number of factories meeting the refugee employment threshold. Rules-of-origin compliance proved administratively complex for many Jordanian firms. However, the work permit programme in non-SEZ sectors, particularly agriculture and construction, showed greater uptake.\n\nThe Compact successfully mobilized significant resources: between 2016 and 2020, Jordan received over $6 billion in grants and concessional finance linked to the refugee response. Education access expanded, with the \"double-shift\" school system accommodating Syrian students in afternoon sessions. Zaatari camp, home to approximately 80,000 refugees, developed its own informal economy with over 3,000 shops and businesses.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Jordan Compact has faced significant criticism. Lenner and Turner (2019) argued that the model prioritized donor interests in migration containment over genuine refugee welfare. Work permits were restricted to specific sectors and did not allow Syrians to use their professional qualifications, meaning doctors, engineers, and teachers worked in manufacturing or agriculture. Women's labor force participation among refugees remained extremely low, below 5%.\n\nJordanian public resentment toward refugees grew as economic conditions deteriorated, with many Jordanians perceiving competition for jobs and resources. The informal labor market continued to absorb the majority of working Syrians, undermining the formal work-permit framework.\n\nBetts and Collier's model was criticized by Crawley and Skleparis (2018) for oversimplifying refugee agency and assuming market-based solutions would address fundamentally political displacement. The sustainability of the model depends on continued donor financing, raising questions about long-term viability.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Linking trade concessions to refugee employment is conceptually innovative but faces practical implementation barriers in weak labor markets\n- Refugee economic integration requires formal recognition of skills and qualifications, not just access to low-wage sectors\n- Concessional financing for middle-income host countries (the GCFF model) fills a genuine gap in the international financial architecture\n- Host community support must be embedded in refugee response to maintain public support and social cohesion\n- Informal economies often outcompete formal work-permit frameworks when regulations are restrictive or wages are uncompetitive\n- Women's economic inclusion requires specific interventions beyond general labor market access\n\n## References\n\n1.
