  "content": "## Background\n\nTraditional development aid has long been delivered through in-kind transfers (food, goods, services) or conditional programs requiring recipients to meet behavioral requirements. The assumption underlying these approaches was that poor people lacked the knowledge or discipline to make good decisions about resource allocation and needed expert guidance. This paternalistic framework was rarely questioned despite limited evidence supporting it.\n\nMeanwhile, the rapid expansion of mobile money in East Africa, particularly M-Pesa in Kenya (launched 2007), created the technological infrastructure to transfer money directly to poor households at minimal cost. GiveDirectly, founded in 2009 by economists Michael Faye, Paul Niehaus, Jeremy Shapiro, and Rohit Wanchoo, seized this opportunity to test a radically simple proposition: give poor people cash and let them decide how to spend it.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nGiveDirectly's model is deliberately minimalist. The organization identifies extremely poor households (typically using proxy means testing based on housing materials), verifies eligibility through field visits, registers recipients' mobile money accounts, and transfers approximately $1,000 per household (equivalent to about one year's consumption expenditure). Recipients receive no conditions, training, or monitoring of their spending decisions.\n\nThe organization's overhead costs have been kept remarkably low, with approximately 83–88 cents of every donated dollar reaching recipients. This efficiency is enabled by mobile money infrastructure, which eliminates the need for physical distribution networks, and by the simplicity of the model, which requires minimal staff and no program design or training components.\n\nGiveDirectly has expanded its model over time. The standard one-time lump-sum transfer has been complemented by experiments with monthly payments, larger transfers ($1,500–$2,000), and a landmark 12-year Universal Basic Income (UBI) study launched in 2017 across 295 villages in Siaya County, Kenya. This UBI experiment, involving over 20,000 individuals receiving approximately $0.75 per adult per day, is the largest and longest-running basic income trial in a developing country.\n\nThe organization has also deployed emergency cash transfers in response to crises, including after Hurricane Harvey in Houston (2017), during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in conflict-affected regions of the DRC.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro (2016), published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, reported results from a randomized controlled trial in rural Kenya. Large ($1,525) lump-sum transfers led to significant increases in consumption (0.1 standard deviations), assets (particularly livestock and durable goods), food security, and psychological well-being. Crucially, there was no increase in spending on alcohol or tobacco (\"temptation goods\"), directly contradicting the assumption that the poor would waste cash transfers.\n\nThe three-year follow-up (Haushofer and Shapiro, 2018) found that many gains persisted, though some had attenuated. Asset increases endured, but consumption gains diminished as the transfer was spent down. This finding motivated interest in recurring transfers and the UBI experiment.\n\nEgger et al. (2022), published in *Econometrica*, studied the general equilibrium effects of GiveDirectly's large-scale program in Kenya, finding that cash transfers generated a local fiscal multiplier of 2.6: every dollar transferred generated $2.60 in local economic activity through increased spending and enterprise revenue. This finding suggested that cash transfers could stimulate local economies beyond direct recipient benefits.\n\nGiveDirectly's model has also served as a benchmark for cost-effectiveness analysis. GiveWell and other evaluators have used the measured effects of unconditional cash transfers as a comparison point for assessing other development interventions, asking: \"Does this program do more good per dollar than simply giving the money to poor people?\"\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCritics have raised several concerns. Blattman and Niehaus (2014) noted that while cash transfers are effective at alleviating immediate deprivation, they may not address structural barriers to development such as weak institutions, inadequate infrastructure, or market failures that constrain economic opportunity.\n\nThe scalability of the model through philanthropic funding has been questioned. Government-run cash transfer programs (like Kenya's own Inua Jamii) operate at far larger scale but face different political economy constraints. Whether GiveDirectly's targeting and delivery mechanisms can be replicated by governments remains uncertain.\n\nInflation concerns have also been raised, particularly for large-scale transfers in small, closed economies. While the Egger et al. (2022) study found minimal inflationary effects, this may not hold in all contexts.\n\nSome development practitioners argue that the focus on cash transfers diverts attention from systemic issues like governance reform, public goods provision, and structural transformation that require collective action rather than individual transfers.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Poor people generally make reasonable spending decisions when given resources, challenging paternalistic assumptions in development aid\n- Mobile money technology has dramatically reduced the cost and complexity of direct cash transfers\n- Unconditional cash transfers provide a rigorous benchmark against which other development interventions should be measured\n- One-time transfers produce temporary consumption gains; sustained poverty reduction likely requires recurring support or investments that generate lasting income changes\n- General equilibrium effects (local economic multipliers) should be considered when evaluating transfer programs\n\n## References\n\n1.
