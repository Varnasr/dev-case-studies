  "content": "## Background\n\nCape Verde, an archipelago of ten volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 570 kilometers off the west coast of Africa, gained independence from Portugal in 1975 with extraordinarily limited development prospects. The country had no significant mineral resources, only 10% of the land was arable, chronic drought afflicted the Sahelian-climate islands, and the population of roughly 300,000 had been shaped by centuries of colonial neglect, slave trade history, and periodic famines that killed tens of thousands. A devastating famine in 1947 killed an estimated 30,000 people, roughly 15% of the population.\n\nAt independence, Cape Verde was one of the poorest countries in the world, with GDP per capita estimated at approximately US$190. The economy depended on subsistence agriculture, fishing, and remittances from the large diaspora, which had emigrated to the United States (particularly New England), Portugal, and other destinations over generations of hardship. The newly independent state, led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC/PAICV), faced the fundamental challenge of building a viable economy on a water-scarce archipelago with minimal natural resources.\n\nDespite these constraints, Cape Verde embarked on a development trajectory that would distinguish it from most Sub-Saharan African countries. The early post-independence government invested heavily in education and health, establishing universal primary education and expanding healthcare access. By 1990, literacy rates had risen from approximately 37% at independence to over 70%, and life expectancy increased significantly. The country maintained political stability even during the transition from single-party to multiparty democracy in 1991, when the ruling PAICV peacefully ceded power after losing elections.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nCape Verde's development strategy evolved through several phases, each building on previous achievements. The first phase (1975-1990) focused on state-led investment in human capital, particularly education and health, financed largely by foreign aid and remittances. The second phase began with democratic transition in 1991 and economic liberalization, including privatization of state enterprises, trade opening, and creation of an enabling environment for foreign investment in tourism.\n\nTourism emerged as the primary growth driver from the late 1990s onward, particularly on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista where all-inclusive beach resort development attracted European tourists, primarily from the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, and the Netherlands. The government invested in airport infrastructure, expanding international airports on Sal and Boa Vista and improving inter-island transport. Tax incentives and investment promotion attracted international hotel chains and real estate developers.\n\nGood governance became Cape Verde's distinctive brand. The country consistently ranked among the top performers in Africa on governance indicators including the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, Freedom House democratic freedom scores, and Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The UNDP case study on Cape Verde highlighted how the country leveraged its governance reputation to attract development assistance well above what its population size would normally warrant, and to negotiate favorable terms for market access, including a special partnership agreement with the European Union signed in 2007.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nIn 2007, Cape Verde became only the second country (after Botswana in 1994) to graduate from the United Nations' Least Developed Country (LDC) category, meeting the criteria for income per capita, human assets, and economic vulnerability. GDP per capita had risen to approximately $3,600 by 2019, placing Cape Verde among the lower-middle-income countries. The Human Development Index reached 0.662 in 2019, classified as medium human development and ranking among the highest in West Africa.\n\nTourism grew dramatically, from approximately 115,000 arrivals in 2000 to 819,000 in 2019, contributing roughly 25% of GDP directly and indirectly. Remittances, while declining as a share of GDP from roughly 20% in the 1990s to approximately 12% by the 2010s, continued to provide a crucial financial inflow estimated at US$200 million annually. The combination of tourism revenue, remittances, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment financed consistent growth averaging approximately 4-5% annually from 2000 to 2019.\n\nDemocratic stability was maintained through five peaceful transfers of power between the PAICV and MpD parties since 1991, making Cape Verde one of Africa's most stable democracies. Freedom House has consistently rated Cape Verde as \"Free,\" and the country has served as a model for democratic governance in Africa. Baker (2006) documented the deepening of democratic culture, showing high levels of popular support for democratic norms and practices in Afrobarometer surveys.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe LDC graduation raised concerns about the loss of preferential trade access and concessional aid. The UN Economic Vulnerability Index classified Cape Verde as highly vulnerable due to its small size, remoteness, economic concentration, and environmental fragility, suggesting that the income-based graduation criteria did not fully capture the country's structural vulnerabilities. Aid flows did decline after graduation, forcing the government to increase domestic revenue mobilization and access non-concessional borrowing.\n\nTourism dependence creates significant vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which devastated the tourism sector and caused GDP to contract by approximately 14% in 2020, one of the sharpest declines globally. Youth unemployment, particularly among those without tertiary education, remained stubbornly high at approximately 30%, fueling continued emigration. Inter-island inequality persists, with economic activity concentrated on Santiago, Sal, and Boa Vista while smaller islands like Fogo and Brava lag behind. Water scarcity remains a fundamental constraint, requiring expensive desalination.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Investment in human capital, particularly education and health, can lay foundations for economic transformation even in severely resource-constrained environments, as Cape Verde's early post-independence choices demonstrate.\n- Good governance and democratic stability can become a competitive advantage for small states, attracting disproportionate aid, investment, and favorable trade terms relative to economic size.\n- Tourism can drive growth in small island economies but creates dependency that amplifies vulnerability to external shocks, as COVID-19 dramatically demonstrated.\n- LDC graduation, while a development milestone, can reduce access to concessional financing and trade preferences, requiring careful transition planning.\n- Diaspora engagement through remittances and transnational networks provides a vital resource for small states, but managing brain drain and incentivizing return migration remain ongoing challenges.\n\n## References\n\n- UNDP (2010). *Cape Verde: Graduation from the LDC Category*.
