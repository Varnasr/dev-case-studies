  "content": "## Background\n\nSierra Leone emerged from a brutal eleven-year civil war (1991-2002) with a shattered health system. Decades of conflict and underdevelopment had left the country with some of the worst health indicators in the world. Maternal mortality was among the highest globally, estimated at approximately 1,165 per 100,000 live births. Under-five mortality stood at 156 per 1,000 live births in 2013. The health workforce was critically depleted, with approximately 1 doctor per 50,000 people and severe shortages of nurses, midwives, and community health workers, particularly in rural areas.\n\nIn April 2010, President Ernest Bai Koroma launched the Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI), abolishing user fees for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under five. The FHCI, supported by DFID and other donors, led to significant increases in facility-based deliveries and childhood immunization rates. However, the health system remained fragile, dependent on external financing, and lacking the infrastructure, supplies, and personnel needed to deliver quality care.\n\nThe Ebola virus disease outbreak that reached Sierra Leone in May 2014 exposed and exacerbated these weaknesses with catastrophic consequences. The epidemic lasted until November 2015, infecting 14,124 people and killing 3,956, according to WHO figures. The virus overwhelmed the health system, and the fear and disruption it caused led to a collapse in routine health service utilization.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Ebola epidemic's impact extended far beyond direct mortality. An estimated 296 health workers were infected, of whom 221 died, representing a devastating loss for an already depleted workforce. Health facility utilization dropped by approximately 50% during the epidemic, as people avoided clinics for fear of infection. Routine immunization, antenatal care, and treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV were severely disrupted. Modeling studies published in *The Lancet* estimated that indirect deaths from reduced access to healthcare during the epidemic may have exceeded direct Ebola deaths.\n\nThe post-Ebola recovery effort was articulated in the government's \"Recover to Build Back Better\" plan (2015-2020), which requested $1.3 billion from the international community. The plan prioritized three areas: restoring basic health services, building resilient health systems, and strengthening disease surveillance and response capacity. Key interventions included expansion of the community health worker programme, rehabilitation and re-equipping of health facilities, strengthening laboratory networks and real-time disease surveillance systems, and investment in health worker training and retention.\n\nThe Lancet Commission on the Future of Health in Sub-Saharan Africa (2017) and the Harvard-LSHTM Independent Panel on the Global Response to Ebola (Moon et al., 2015) both emphasized that the epidemic exposed the consequences of chronic underinvestment in health systems and called for fundamental reforms in global health security architecture.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nPost-Ebola health system rebuilding achieved some notable gains. The community health worker programme was substantially expanded, with over 15,000 CHWs deployed across the country by 2018, providing basic health services and surveillance at the community level. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system was strengthened, and Sierra Leone's capacity to detect and respond to disease outbreaks improved significantly, as demonstrated during the 2022 response to other infectious disease alerts.\n\nHealth service utilization recovered gradually. Facility-based deliveries, which had dropped sharply during Ebola, returned to and eventually exceeded pre-outbreak levels by 2017-2018. Immunization coverage recovered, though it remained below pre-Ebola levels in some districts. The government increased the health budget, though it remained well below the Abuja Declaration target of 15% of government spending.\n\nHowever, progress was uneven and the underlying structural weaknesses of the health system persisted. Wurie et al. (2016), writing in *The Lancet Global Health*, documented the devastating impact of the epidemic on the health workforce and the challenges of rebuilding, including competition from NGOs offering higher salaries and the ongoing challenge of rural retention. A 2019 assessment found that while surveillance capacity had improved, many health facilities still lacked basic equipment, drugs, and trained staff.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe post-Ebola period raised fundamental questions about the sustainability and equity of health system development in low-income, fragile states. The surge in international attention and funding that accompanied the Ebola response was followed by a gradual decline in donor engagement, raising concerns about whether gains would be sustained. Much of the post-Ebola investment was channeled through parallel structures and international organizations rather than strengthening government systems.\n\nCritics, including Benton and Dionne (2015), argued that the Ebola crisis was fundamentally a consequence of structural inequality and the failure of the international community to invest in health systems in the world's poorest countries before the crisis. The post-Ebola rebuilding effort, while necessary, risked repeating the pattern of emergency-driven, vertical investment rather than the sustained horizontal health system strengthening needed to prevent future crises. Sierra Leone's health outcomes, while improving, remain among the worst globally, reflecting the enormity of the challenge.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Epidemic preparedness requires investment in baseline health system capacity, not just disease-specific surveillance; Ebola devastated Sierra Leone precisely because the health system was already critically weak.\n- Health workforce development is the binding constraint in many low-income health systems; the loss of 221 health workers to Ebola set back capacity building by years.\n- Community health workers can extend health system reach into underserved areas, but they require ongoing supervision, supplies, and compensation.\n- Post-crisis recovery offers an opportunity to \"build back better,\" but sustaining reform momentum after international attention fades is a persistent challenge.\n- Global health security is inseparable from health system strengthening; investment in basic services in the poorest countries is both a development imperative and a security necessity.\n\n## References\n\n- Moon, S., Sridhar, D., Pate, M.
