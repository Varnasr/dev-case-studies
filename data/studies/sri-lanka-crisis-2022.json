The crisis was triggered by a toxic combination of long-term fiscal mismanagement, pandemic-induced tourism collapse, and a catastrophic policy blunder: the abrupt ban on synthetic fertilizers in April 2021, which devastated agricultural output and destroyed the livelihoods of millions of farmers. The resulting food shortages, fuel queues stretching for kilometers, 13-hour power cuts, and medicine scarcity ignited the Aragalaya ('struggle') protest movement, which forced President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country in July 2022. Sri Lanka subsequently entered an IMF program worth $2.9 billion, restructured its debt with international creditors, and began a painful austerity-driven recovery. Verdict: Sri Lanka's crisis is a textbook case of how populist economics — tax cuts without spending cuts, vanity infrastructure projects financed by sovereign bonds, and ideologically driven agricultural policy — can destroy a middle-income country's economy in less than three years.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nSri Lanka entered the 21st century as South Asia's most developed country by virtually every human development metric. In 2019, its per capita income stood at $4,020 — more than double Bangladesh's and five times Nepal's. Life expectancy was 77 years, adult literacy exceeded 92%, the maternal mortality ratio was 36 per 100,000 (compared to India's 103), and the country had a functioning universal healthcare system. Sri Lanka had achieved the demographic transition decades before its neighbors and boasted a human development index (HDI) of 0.782 — the highest in South Asia.\n\nBut beneath these impressive social indicators lay deep structural vulnerabilities.\n\n**Chronic twin deficits:** Sri Lanka had run fiscal deficits averaging 5-7% of GDP for decades and current account deficits averaging 3-4% of GDP. The government consistently spent more than it earned and imported more than it exported. Revenue collection was chronically weak: tax revenue as a share of GDP fell from 14.8% in 2010 to just 8.1% in 2020 — one of the lowest rates in Asia. Meanwhile, government expenditure remained sticky at 18-20% of GDP, driven by a bloated public sector (1.5 million government employees for a 22-million population), military spending (the legacy of the 26-year civil war with the LTTE, which ended in 2009), and subsidies.\n\n**Debt accumulation:** To finance these deficits, successive governments borrowed — increasingly from commercial markets rather than concessional lenders. Sri Lanka's total external debt rose from $11.3 billion in 2005 to $51 billion by 2019. Critically, the composition of debt shifted: the share of concessional debt (from the World Bank, ADB, and bilateral donors at low interest rates) fell from 64% in 2005 to about 30% by 2019, while International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) — commercial debt at market interest rates of 6-7% — rose to 47% of external debt. This shift meant that debt service costs ballooned: by 2019, Sri Lanka was spending approximately $4-5 billion per year on external debt repayment, against total government revenue of roughly $12 billion.\n\n**The China factor:** Chinese lending to Sri Lanka became politically explosive. Between 2005 and 2019, China provided approximately $7-8 billion in loans for infrastructure projects, including the Hambantota Port ($1.4 billion), the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport ($209 million), and the Colombo Port City ($1.4 billion). When Sri Lanka could not service the Hambantota Port loan, it agreed in 2017 to lease the port to China Merchants Port Holdings for 99 years in exchange for $1.12 billion — a transaction that became a global symbol of 'debt-trap diplomacy.' However, economists have argued the China debt-trap narrative is overblown: Chinese lending constituted roughly 10-15% of Sri Lanka's total external debt, while ISBs (held by Western financial institutions) constituted nearly half.\n\n**The tourism-remittance vulnerability:** Sri Lanka's foreign exchange earnings depended heavily on four sources: garment exports ($5.4 billion in 2019), tourism ($4.4 billion), remittances ($6.7 billion), and tea exports ($1.3 billion). Tourism and remittances together accounted for over 60% of current account receipts. This concentration made the balance of payments extremely vulnerable to global shocks — a vulnerability that would prove devastating when COVID-19 hit.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe crisis was not the result of a single policy failure but a cascade of decisions that interacted catastrophically.\n\n**Phase 1: The Rajapaksa tax cuts (November 2019):** Gotabaya Rajapaksa, elected president in November 2019, fulfilled a campaign promise by implementing the largest tax cut in Sri Lankan history. The Value Added Tax (VAT) rate was slashed from 15% to 8%, the Nation Building Tax was abolished, the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) income tax was abolished, corporate tax rates were reduced, and the threshold for income tax liability was raised sharply. These cuts reduced government revenue by an estimated Rs 600-800 billion ($3.2-4.3 billion) annually — roughly 2-3% of GDP. The cuts were implemented without corresponding spending reductions. Budget deficit widened to 11.1% of GDP in 2020 (from 6.8% in 2019).\n\n**Phase 2: COVID-19 and money printing (March 2020 - 2021):** The pandemic collapsed tourism overnight — tourist arrivals fell from 1.9 million in 2019 to 173,000 in 2020. Remittances through formal channels declined as migrant workers lost jobs in the Gulf and increasingly sent money through informal hawala channels (attracted by the black market premium on foreign exchange). Rather than approaching the IMF for emergency financing, the Rajapaksa government chose to finance the deficit through Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) money printing. The CBSL purchased Rs 1.2 trillion ($6.4 billion equivalent) in government securities between March 2020 and August 2021 — an extraordinary monetary expansion for a small economy. This injected liquidity that fueled imports, drained foreign reserves, and planted the seeds of hyperinflation.\n\n**Phase 3: The organic farming disaster (April 2021):** In April 2021, President Rajapaksa banned the import of synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals, mandating an overnight transition to 100% organic farming. The stated rationale was public health (reducing chronic kidney disease linked to agrochemicals) and foreign exchange savings ($400 million in annual fertilizer imports). The actual motivation appeared to combine genuine environmental conviction with foreign exchange desperation.\n\nThe effects were catastrophic and immediate. Rice production fell by approximately 20% in the 2021 Maha (main) season. Tea production — Sri Lanka's third-largest export earner — fell by 15-18%, costing an estimated $425 million in export revenue. Vegetable production collapsed in parts of the hill country, and prices spiked: rice prices increased by 50-80% between April and November 2021. Farmers who had used synthetic fertilizers for decades had no knowledge of organic methods, no access to sufficient organic inputs, and no time to transition. An estimated 90% of Sri Lanka's 2 million farming families were negatively affected.\n\nThe ban was partially reversed in November 2021 (for tea and rubber) and fully reversed in early 2022, but the damage was done. The net foreign exchange loss from reduced agricultural exports and the need to import rice and other foodstuffs far exceeded the $400 million saved on fertilizer imports.\n\n**Phase 4: Reserve depletion and default (January - May 2022):** By January 2022, usable foreign exchange reserves had fallen to approximately $500 million — against $7 billion in debt payments due in 2022 alone. The government maintained the exchange rate at an artificially strong Rs 200-203 per dollar (against a market rate of Rs 350+), creating a black market premium of 40-70%. This incentivized informal remittance channels and discouraged exporters from repatriating earnings, further draining reserves.\n\nThe CBSL finally abandoned the peg in March 2022, and the rupee immediately collapsed from Rs 200 to Rs 360 per dollar (reaching Rs 450 at its worst). On April 12, 2022, Sri Lanka announced it was suspending payments on approximately $12 billion in external debt — the country's first-ever sovereign default.\n\n**Phase 5: The Aragalaya and political collapse (March - July 2022):** As fuel queues stretched for kilometers (with people waiting 3-5 days for petrol), power cuts reached 13 hours daily, cooking gas became unavailable, and medicine shortages closed hospital wards, a spontaneous protest movement — the Aragalaya ('struggle' in Sinhala) — erupted. Beginning on March 31, 2022, with small protests outside the president's residence, it grew into the largest civic movement in Sri Lankan history. On July 9, 2022, hundreds of thousands of people stormed the Presidential Secretariat, the President's House, and the Prime Minister's official residence. Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives (and then Singapore) on a military jet on July 13, and formally resigned on July 15. Parliament elected Ranil Wickremesinghe as president on July 20.\n\n**Phase 6: IMF bailout and recovery (September 2022 - present):** The Wickremesinghe government reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF on September 1, 2022, for a $2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility over four years. The program required sweeping conditions: increase VAT to 18%, raise income tax rates, bring electricity tariffs to cost-recovery levels, reform state-owned enterprises (particularly Sri Lankan Airlines and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation), increase government revenue to 15% of GDP by 2025, reduce the primary fiscal deficit, and restructure both domestic and external debt. Creditor negotiations proved complex: China, India, Japan, and bilateral creditors provided financing assurances by early 2023; ISB holders agreed to a restructuring in September 2024 involving 28% haircuts on principal.\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe theoretical framework for understanding Sri Lanka's crisis draws on several strands of macroeconomic theory.\n\n**Twin deficit dynamics:** The fiscal deficit-current account deficit nexus is well-documented. When a government runs large fiscal deficits financed by domestic borrowing and money creation, it drives up demand for imports (through higher aggregate demand) while reducing the competitiveness of exports (through real exchange rate appreciation). Sri Lanka ran this playbook for decades.\n\n**The Impossible Trinity:** Sri Lanka attempted to maintain a fixed exchange rate, conduct independent monetary policy (money printing), and maintain open capital accounts — the classic impossible trinity. The CBSL's money printing was directly contradicting the exchange rate peg, draining reserves as the central bank sold dollars to defend the peg while simultaneously creating rupees through government securities purchases.\n\n**The organic farming ban as a supply shock:** The fertilizer ban can be understood as a self-inflicted supply shock — analogous to an oil price spike, but hitting agriculture. It simultaneously reduced domestic food supply (increasing inflation), reduced agricultural exports (worsening the current account), and increased the need for food imports (accelerating reserve depletion). The timing — in the middle of an ongoing balance of payments crisis — was particularly devastating.\n\n**Political economy of populism:** The Rajapaksa tax cuts followed a classic populist pattern: delivering visible short-term benefits (lower taxes) while generating invisible long-term costs (fiscal deficits, debt accumulation). The organic farming ban followed a different populist logic — paternalistic utopianism — where ideological conviction overrode practical analysis and expert advice.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\n**Economic collapse by the numbers:**\n- GDP contracted by 7.8% in 2022 — the sharpest decline since independence\n- Headline inflation peaked at 69.8% in September 2022 (food inflation: 93.7%)\n- The rupee depreciated from Rs 200/USD in March 2022 to Rs 360/USD by July 2022\n- Foreign reserves hit a low of $25 million in net usable terms by mid-2022\n- 500,000 Sri Lankans fell below the poverty line in 2022 alone (World Bank estimate)\n- Poverty rate increased from 13.1% (2019) to an estimated 25.6% (2022) — effectively reversing a decade of poverty reduction\n\n**Agricultural impact of the fertilizer ban:**\n- Rice paddy production fell 20% in the 2021/22 Maha season\n- Tea production fell from 300 million kg in 2021 to 256 million kg in 2022 (15% decline)\n- Sri Lanka was forced to import $450 million in rice in 2022, having been largely self-sufficient before\n- Farmer income losses estimated at Rs 200-300 billion ($650 million-$1 billion) across 2021-2022\n\n**Human impact:**\n- UNICEF reported that 5.7 million Sri Lankans (26% of the population) were food insecure by September 2022\n- School attendance dropped as families could not afford transport costs\n- Out-migration surged: an estimated 300,000+ Sri Lankans left the country in 2022 alone — the highest emigration rate since the civil war\n- At least 16 people died in fuel queues (from exhaustion, heart attacks, and violence) between March and July 2022\n\n**Recovery trajectory:**\n- GDP growth returned to positive territory in 2023 (estimated +1.5 to +2%)\n- Inflation fell sharply to single digits by mid-2023 as monetary tightening took effect\n- Tourism recovered partially: 1.5 million arrivals in 2023 (vs. 1.9 million in 2019)\n- Foreign reserves rebuilt to approximately $4.4 billion by end-2023\n- But government revenue-side reforms imposed heavy burdens: the VAT increase and income tax rises reduced disposable income for the middle class, and electricity tariff hikes of 65-75% hit households and businesses\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**The tax cuts were economically illiterate.** Sri Lanka's tax-to-GDP ratio was already dangerously low (11.6% in 2019) before the Rajapaksa cuts slashed it to 8.1%. No serious economist recommended tax cuts in a country running 7% fiscal deficits. The cuts were designed to win political popularity — Rajapaksa had run on a platform of prosperity and national pride — but they destroyed fiscal space at precisely the moment when the pandemic would require massive emergency spending.\n\n**The refusal to go to the IMF early was catastrophic.** By mid-2020, it was clear that Sri Lanka faced a severe balance of payments crisis. The IMF offered emergency financing under its Rapid Financing Instrument. The government refused, reportedly because Rajapaksa and his advisors viewed an IMF program as politically humiliating and feared the conditions would require reversing the tax cuts. This delay of 18-24 months — between when an IMF program was clearly needed and when it was finally agreed — allowed reserves to drain from $6.9 billion to near zero, turning a manageable crisis into a catastrophe.\n\n**The organic farming ban ignored all expert advice.** The ban was implemented against the unanimous recommendation of the Agricultural Ministry's own scientists, university agricultural faculties, and international experts. The Rajapaksa government relied instead on a small circle of organic farming advocates and the president's personal conviction that agrochemicals were responsible for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the North Central Province. While CKD is a genuine public health problem, the scientific evidence linking it to agrochemicals is contested, and even supportive scientists recommended a 5-10 year phased transition, not an overnight ban.\n\n**The fixed exchange rate accelerated reserve depletion.** Maintaining the peg at Rs 200/USD when the market-clearing rate was Rs 350+ was economically indefensible. It rewarded importers (who got cheap dollars), punished exporters (who received fewer rupees for their earnings), and — most critically — encouraged remittance senders to use informal hawala channels (which offered Rs 280-300/USD on the black market). Formal remittance inflows fell from $7.1 billion in 2020 to $5.5 billion in 2021 despite stable migrant employment, suggesting $1.5-2 billion shifted to informal channels.\n\n**Debt management was reckless.** The shift from concessional to commercial borrowing through ISBs was a deliberate strategy pursued by the Rajapaksa governments (Mahinda Rajapaksa, president 2005-2015, and then his brother Gotabaya from 2019). ISBs were attractive because they came without policy conditions — unlike World Bank or ADB loans, which required governance reforms. But ISBs carried interest rates of 6-7% (compared to 1-2% for concessional loans) and had shorter maturities. By 2019, Sri Lanka was on a debt treadmill: issuing new ISBs primarily to repay maturing ones.\n\n**The political system concentrated power dangerously.** The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, passed in October 2020, reversed the governance reforms of the 19th Amendment and concentrated enormous power in the presidency. It removed term limits, gave the president power to appoint and dismiss ministers, judges, and the heads of independent commissions, and removed parliamentary oversight of many executive decisions. This institutional concentration enabled the fertilizer ban — which might have been blocked by a cabinet or parliamentary review process — to be implemented by executive fiat.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. Revenue adequacy is non-negotiable.** Sri Lanka's crisis was fundamentally a fiscal crisis. No country can sustain government expenditure of 18-20% of GDP with tax revenue of 8% indefinitely. Tax cuts during fiscal distress are not stimulus — they are suicide. South Asian countries with similar revenue-to-GDP ratios (Pakistan at 9.2%, Nepal at 10.5%) should take note.\n\n**2. Go to the IMF early, not late.** The cost of delayed adjustment is enormous. Had Sri Lanka entered an IMF program in mid-2020, the conditions would have been less harsh, reserves would have been preserved, and the worst of the humanitarian crisis avoided. The political cost of early adjustment is always perceived as higher than it actually is; the economic cost of delayed adjustment is always higher than expected.\n\n**3. Agricultural policy requires evidence, not ideology.** The organic farming ban is a cautionary tale for the global movement toward chemical-free agriculture. Organic farming can work — but it requires years of soil preparation, farmer training, input supply chain development, and yield management. Overnight mandates destroy production. Any agricultural transition must be phased, voluntary, and supported by research and extension services.\n\n**4. Sovereign bond borrowing requires extreme discipline.** ISBs are not 'free money' — they are the most expensive and least forgiving form of sovereign debt. Countries that shift from concessional to commercial borrowing must simultaneously improve revenue collection and export earnings. Sri Lanka's experience suggests that ISB access for lower-middle-income countries should come with stronger market discipline — rating agencies and bond investors failed to price in Sri Lanka's deteriorating fundamentals until it was too late.\n\n**5. Institutional checks matter.** The 20th Amendment's concentration of power removed the guardrails that might have prevented the worst policy errors. Independent central banks, parliamentary budget oversight, and evidence-based policy review processes are not bureaucratic luxuries — they are essential safeguards against populist economic destruction.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value | Year/Period | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| GDP growth | -7.8% | 2022 | Central Bank of Sri Lanka |\n| Peak inflation rate | 69.8% (food: 93.7%) | September 2022 | CBSL |\n| Total external debt at default | ~$51 billion | April 2022 | Ministry of Finance |\n| Foreign reserves at lowest point | ~$25-50 million (net usable) | Mid-2022 | CBSL |\n| Tax revenue as % of GDP (post-cuts) | 8.1% | 2020 | IMF Article IV |\n| Fiscal deficit | 11.1% of GDP | 2020 | CBSL |\n| Rice production decline | ~20% | 2021-22 Maha season | Dept. of Census & Statistics |\n| Tea production decline | 15% (300M to 256M kg) | 2021-2022 | Sri Lanka Tea Board |\n| Poverty rate increase | 13.1% to ~25.6% | 2019-2022 | World Bank estimate |\n| IMF program value | $2.9 billion (4-year EFF) | March 2023 | IMF |\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

How should we evaluate the relative responsibility of bilateral lenders (China, Japan, India) vs. commercial creditors (ISB holders) in Sri Lanka's debt crisis? Does the 'debt-trap diplomacy' framing serve analytical clarity or geopolitical narrative-building?\n\n2. **The organic farming ban as cautionary tale:** Many countries — from the EU to Bhutan to parts of India — are promoting organic or chemical-free agriculture. What lessons does Sri Lanka's experience offer for designing sustainable agricultural transitions? Is the problem with organic farming itself, or with how the policy was implemented?\n\n3. **Austerity and social contract:** The IMF program requires painful reforms — higher taxes, higher electricity prices, public sector restructuring — that disproportionately burden the middle class and poor. Given that the crisis was caused by elite policy decisions, is it fair that recovery costs are borne by ordinary citizens? How should IMF programs be designed to protect the most vulnerable during fiscal adjustment?"
