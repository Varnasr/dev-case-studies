  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the late 1990s, global immunization coverage had stagnated. While vaccines for diseases like hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and yellow fever existed, they remained largely unavailable in the world's poorest countries. A child born in a low-income country was ten times less likely to receive basic vaccines than one born in a wealthy nation. Pharmaceutical companies had limited incentive to develop or produce vaccines for markets that could not afford them, creating a persistent gap between the development of new vaccines and their deployment in the countries that needed them most.\n\nThe Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), launched by WHO in 1974, had achieved notable successes but lacked the financing and market-shaping capacity to close this gap. Routine immunization coverage in the poorest countries had plateaued at around 59% for DTP3 (three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine).\n\n## The Intervention\n\nGAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, was launched in 2000 at the World Economic Forum in Davos with an initial $750 million pledge from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It brought together governments, WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, civil society, and the pharmaceutical industry in a public-private partnership designed to increase access to immunization in the world's poorest countries.\n\nGAVI's model combined several innovative elements. First, it pooled demand from low-income countries to negotiate lower vaccine prices, achieving reductions of up to 95% for some vaccines. Second, it introduced co-financing requirements, with countries gradually increasing their contributions as their economies grew, building toward self-financing and eventual graduation from GAVI support.\n\nThe Advance Market Commitment (AMC), piloted in 2009 for pneumococcal vaccines, represented a groundbreaking financing mechanism. Donors committed $1.5 billion to guarantee a viable market for pneumococcal vaccines, incentivizing manufacturers to invest in production capacity for developing country markets. Within five years, three manufacturers were supplying pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at $3.30 per dose to GAVI countries, compared to over $100 per dose in the United States.\n\nGAVI also supported the introduction of rotavirus vaccines (beginning 2012), human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and more recently COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility. The International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), launched in 2006, used donor pledges to issue bonds on capital markets, frontloading funding for immunization programs.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nGAVI's impact has been substantial and well-documented. By 2023, the alliance reported having helped immunize over one billion children and averted an estimated 17.3 million deaths since 2000. DTP3 coverage in GAVI-supported countries increased from 59% in 2000 to 81% in 2019, before being disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGlassman et al. (2013) evaluated GAVI's model and found strong evidence of accelerated vaccine introduction in supported countries. The time between vaccine licensure and introduction in low-income countries compressed from an average of 15 years to 3–5 years for newer vaccines. Pentavalent vaccine (DTP-HepB-Hib) coverage in GAVI countries reached 80% by 2015, a remarkable achievement given that Hib and hepatitis B vaccines had been virtually unavailable in these countries before GAVI's founding.\n\nThe AMC model has been particularly well-studied. An independent evaluation found that it successfully accelerated pneumococcal vaccine access, with 60 countries introducing the vaccine through GAVI support by 2020. The economic returns have been estimated at $100 billion in productivity gains from reduced illness and death.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nSeveral challenges persist. Equity within countries remains a concern, as immunization coverage often lags in remote, conflict-affected, and marginalized communities. The \"last mile\" problem, reaching the hardest-to-reach children, has proven far more difficult and expensive than expanding coverage in accessible populations.\n\nSustainability questions arise as countries graduate from GAVI support. Some graduating countries have struggled to maintain coverage levels and continue financing expanded immunization programs. The co-financing model, while designed to promote sustainability, has faced challenges in countries with limited fiscal space.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant setbacks, with routine immunization coverage in GAVI countries declining and millions of children missing scheduled vaccinations. The COVAX facility, while distributing 1.9 billion doses, fell short of its original equity targets and was criticized for being outcompeted by wealthy nations in vaccine procurement.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Public-private partnerships can effectively shape markets to serve the poorest populations when properly designed\n- Innovative financing mechanisms (AMC, IFFIm) can accelerate access to health technologies in developing countries\n- Demand pooling and co-financing create pathways toward country ownership and sustainability\n- Equity within countries requires targeted strategies beyond national coverage averages\n- Pandemic preparedness must be integrated into routine immunization infrastructure\n\n## References\n\n1.
