  "content": "## Background\n\nNigeria, despite being Africa's largest economy and a major oil producer, had among the continent's highest absolute numbers of people living in extreme poverty. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that 40.1% of the population—approximately 83 million people—lived below the national poverty line as of 2018/19. This paradox of oil wealth and mass poverty reflected decades of misgovernance, corruption, inequality, and the failure of oil revenues to translate into broad-based development.\n\nPrior to 2016, Nigeria had minimal formal social protection infrastructure compared to peer countries. A conditional cash transfer pilot (In Care of the People, or COPE) was launched in 2007 in 12 states, reaching approximately 22,000 households, but it remained small-scale and was not sustained. The country lacked a national social registry to identify the poor, and social spending as a share of GDP was among the lowest in Africa. Political economy dynamics—including the federal structure, patronage politics, and rentier state dynamics—had historically impeded universal social programs.\n\nThe collapse of oil prices in 2014-2016 created both a fiscal crisis and political impetus for reform. President Muhammadu Buhari, elected in 2015 on an anti-corruption and pro-poor platform, committed to establishing a comprehensive social safety net. The National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) was announced as a flagship initiative in the 2016 budget.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe NSIP comprised four main components. First, the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, later branded as the Household Uplifting Programme, targeted the poorest and most vulnerable households with monthly transfers of N5,000 (approximately $14) per household, conditional on children's school attendance and participation in health and nutrition services. The program aimed to reach 1 million households.\n\nSecond, N-Power was a youth employment and social development program that engaged 500,000 university graduates as volunteer workers in schools, health clinics, and agricultural extension, paying them monthly stipends of N30,000 ($83). Third, the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) provided interest-free loans to market traders (TraderMoni), artisans (MarketMoni), and farmers (FarmerMoni), with individual loans typically ranging from N10,000 to N100,000. Fourth, the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme provided free meals to primary school pupils, reaching 9.8 million children across 35 states by 2020.\n\nThe National Social Register (NSR), managed by the National Social Safety Nets Coordinating Office (NASSCO), was developed as the targeting mechanism. It used a community-based targeting approach combined with proxy means testing to identify poor and vulnerable households. By 2020, the register contained data on over 28 million individuals across all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe World Bank's 2020 assessment of Nigeria's social protection system acknowledged the NSIP as a significant institutional development, representing the first attempt at a national-scale social safety net in Nigeria. The school feeding program showed the most visible results, with enrollment increases documented in participating schools and the National Bureau of Statistics reporting that the program contributed to increased school attendance, particularly among girls.\n\nHowever, rigorous independent impact evidence was limited. A 2019 World Bank evaluation of the CCT component found modest positive effects on household food consumption and school enrollment among beneficiaries, but the evaluation's scope was constrained by implementation challenges that made randomized assignment impossible. Premand and Barry (2020), in a World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, analyzed the targeting performance of Nigeria's social registry and found that while the community-based targeting process was participatory, it exhibited significant inclusion and exclusion errors.\n\nN-Power generated positive qualitative evidence of skill development and temporary income support for young graduates, but faced criticism that it functioned more as a temporary employment program than a pathway to sustainable livelihoods. Many participants returned to unemployment after completing their service periods. TraderMoni, while rapidly scaled, faced extremely high default rates and questions about whether the program was genuinely reaching the poorest traders or functioning as a political patronage tool.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nPolitical capture was the most persistent criticism. Opposition parties and civil society organizations alleged that the NSIP was disproportionately deployed in areas loyal to the ruling party and used to build political support ahead of elections. The TraderMoni program was particularly controversial: its rapid expansion in the months before the 2019 elections, with the Vice President personally distributing loans at markets, was widely perceived as vote-buying. The Nigerian Senate conducted investigations into NSIP management, alleging misappropriation of funds.\n\nInstitutional fragmentation undermined coherence. The NSIP was initially housed in the Vice President's office, was then moved to a new Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development in 2019, and faced overlapping mandates with state-level programs and the NASSCO. The transfer value of N5,000 per month was widely considered inadequate—well below international benchmarks of 20% of the poverty line—and had not been adjusted for inflation since the program's inception. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 exposed the weakness of the social registry: when the government attempted to use it for emergency cash transfers, it was found to exclude many of the newly poor and informal sector workers most affected by lockdowns.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Political will for social protection can emerge from economic crisis**: The oil price collapse created a political opening for safety net programs that had previously been considered unnecessary in Africa's largest oil economy.\n- **National social registries require sustained investment and updating**: The NSR represented a valuable institutional asset but needed continuous updating, broader coverage, and protection from political manipulation to serve as an effective targeting tool.\n- **Program independence from electoral politics is essential for credibility**: The perception that NSIP programs were used for political patronage undermined public trust and program legitimacy, regardless of actual impact.\n- **Transfer adequacy determines impact**: At N5,000 per month, the CCT transfer was too small to meaningfully shift household welfare, suggesting that governments face a tradeoff between coverage breadth and per-beneficiary impact.\n- **Youth employment programs need clear graduation pathways**: N-Power provided temporary income but without links to job creation or self-employment support, benefits were largely temporary.\n\n## References\n\n- World Bank (2020). *Nigeria: Social Protection and Jobs Diagnostic*.
