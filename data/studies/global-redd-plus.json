  "content": "## Background\n\nTropical deforestation accounts for approximately 10–15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making forests a critical front in climate change mitigation. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation from its carbon market mechanisms, a significant omission that Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica challenged at the 2005 UNFCCC conference in Montreal. Their proposal to create financial incentives for developing countries to reduce deforestation gained momentum and eventually evolved into what became known as REDD+.\n\nThe underlying logic was compelling: tropical forests store vast quantities of carbon, and their destruction releases it into the atmosphere. Preventing deforestation could be a cost-effective climate mitigation strategy if wealthy nations compensated developing countries for the opportunity costs of forest preservation. The plus in REDD+ signifies the inclusion of conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks beyond simply reducing deforestation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nREDD+ was formally established through decisions at UNFCCC COP13 in Bali (2007) and operationalized through the UN-REDD Programme (launched 2008) and the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). The Warsaw Framework for REDD+ (2013) established the international architecture for results-based payments, requiring countries to develop national strategies, reference emission levels, monitoring systems, and safeguards information systems.\n\nThe mechanism operates in three phases. In the readiness phase, countries develop institutional capacity, national strategies, and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems. The implementation phase involves policy reforms and pilot projects. The results-based payment phase provides financial compensation for verified emission reductions.\n\nNorway has been the largest bilateral donor, pledging $3.5 billion through agreements with Brazil, Indonesia, Guyana, and others. The Norway-Brazil partnership, initiated in 2008, was the flagship: Norway committed up to $1 billion to Brazil's Amazon Fund based on demonstrated reductions in deforestation. Between 2004 and 2012, Brazil reduced Amazon deforestation by approximately 80%, one of the most significant conservation achievements in history.\n\nOther major funding channels include the Green Climate Fund, the FCPF Carbon Fund, and bilateral programs from Germany, the UK, and Japan. Indonesia's REDD+ program has focused on its vast peatland forests, which store enormous quantities of carbon and are threatened by palm oil and pulpwood expansion.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nAngelsen (2009), in the authoritative volume *Realising REDD+*, provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanism's potential and challenges. The analysis emphasized that REDD+ required addressing the underlying drivers of deforestation, including agricultural expansion, logging, and infrastructure development, rather than simply paying for forest protection.\n\nBrazil's experience demonstrated that REDD+ payments, combined with strong domestic policy (enhanced monitoring via the DETER satellite system, enforcement by IBAMA, and the Soy Moratorium), could achieve dramatic results. Nepstad et al. (2014) estimated that Brazil's reduction in Amazon deforestation between 2004 and 2012 avoided 3.2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n\nHowever, Sunderlin et al. (2014) found that subnational REDD+ projects faced significant challenges in ensuring benefits reached local communities and indigenous peoples. Their multi-country study revealed that while REDD+ increased attention to forest governance, actual payments to communities were often delayed or inadequate.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nMRV challenges remain substantial. Accurately measuring forest carbon stocks and deforestation rates requires sophisticated remote sensing and ground-truthing capabilities that many developing countries lack. Setting reference emission levels (baselines) involves contentious methodological choices that can inflate apparent emission reductions.\n\nCarbon leakage, where deforestation prevented in one area simply shifts to another, undermines the climate effectiveness of REDD+. National-level accounting was proposed to address this, but subnational implementation has made leakage difficult to track and prevent.\n\nIndigenous rights tensions have been acute. Many REDD+ projects operate on lands traditionally used by indigenous peoples and local communities who may lack formal tenure. Cases in Indonesia, Peru, and the DRC have highlighted conflicts between carbon conservation and customary land rights. The Cancun Safeguards (2010) established principles for respecting indigenous rights, but implementation and enforcement have been inconsistent.\n\nBrazil's reversal after 2012, with deforestation rates climbing sharply under the Bolsonaro administration (2019–2022), demonstrated the political vulnerability of REDD+ achievements and the limits of international payments when domestic political will shifts.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- International payments can complement but not substitute for strong domestic environmental governance and enforcement\n- Forest conservation achievements can be rapidly reversed when political priorities change\n- Robust MRV systems and transparent baselines are essential for the credibility of results-based payments\n- Indigenous peoples and local communities must be central participants, not merely beneficiaries, of forest conservation programs\n- Addressing underlying drivers of deforestation (agricultural commodity demand, land tenure insecurity) is more important than carbon accounting alone\n\n## References\n\n1.
