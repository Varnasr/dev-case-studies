  "content": "## Background\n\nColombia's worst economic crisis in a century struck in 1999, with GDP contracting by 4.2% and unemployment reaching 20%. The crisis disproportionately affected the poor and coincided with an intensification of the armed conflict between the government, FARC guerrillas, ELN, and paramilitary groups. Existing social protection was fragmented and inadequate: the SISBEN (Sistema de Identificación de Potenciales Beneficiarios de Programas Sociales) targeting system existed but was not linked to a comprehensive transfer program.\n\nInspired by Mexico's Progresa, the Colombian government — with support from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank — designed Familias en Acción as a temporary crisis response program. It was launched in 2001 under President Pastrana, initially planned for three years, but proved so politically popular and evidence-supported that it became permanent.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nFamilias en Acción provides cash transfers to poor families conditional on two requirements: children aged 0–6 must attend regular growth monitoring and health check-ups, and children aged 7–17 must maintain at least 80% school attendance. Transfer amounts vary by component: a nutrition subsidy per family and an education subsidy per child that increases with school level, recognizing the higher opportunity costs of secondary education.\n\nTargeting relies on the SISBEN, a proxy means test that scores households based on observable characteristics (housing quality, assets, demographics, education) to identify the poorest. Initially limited to municipalities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants, the program expanded to major cities in 2007 and eventually reached all municipalities.\n\nThe program was designed with evaluation in mind. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) in London, led by Orazio Attanasio, partnered with the Colombian government to design a rigorous quasi-experimental evaluation using matched comparison municipalities. This evaluation partnership produced one of the most influential CCT evidence bases outside of Mexico's Progresa.\n\nA distinctive feature of Familias en Acción has been its adaptation to Colombia's conflict context. The program extended coverage to internally displaced populations and conflict-affected areas, operating in municipalities where state presence was otherwise minimal. This expansion raised challenges of verification and conditionality enforcement in areas with limited institutional capacity.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nAttanasio et al. (2010) published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics found significant positive impacts across multiple dimensions. In rural areas, secondary school enrollment increased by 5–7 percentage points. Household consumption of protein-rich foods (meat, milk, eggs) increased significantly. Most strikingly, children aged 0–2 in beneficiary households showed improved height-for-age z-scores, indicating reduced chronic malnutrition — a result that was particularly notable given the relatively modest transfer amounts.\n\nAttanasio, Fitzsimons, and Gomez (2005) in the initial IFS evaluation found that the program increased food consumption expenditure by 15% in rural areas and that health check-up attendance for children under 7 increased substantially. The nutrition effects were concentrated among younger children, consistent with the critical importance of early childhood nutrition.\n\nBarera-Osorio et al. (2011) found that the program's school attendance conditions effectively reduced absenteeism and delayed dropout, with the largest effects at the transition from primary to secondary school. However, evidence on learning outcomes was more limited — as in other CCT programs, increased attendance did not automatically translate into improved test scores.\n\nThe program also played a role in Colombia's broader poverty reduction: between 2002 and 2018, poverty fell from 49.7% to 27%, though this decline reflected multiple factors including economic growth, conflict de-escalation, and other social policies alongside Familias en Acción.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nConditionality enforcement has been a persistent challenge, particularly in conflict zones and remote rural areas where schools and health facilities are scarce or inaccessible. Camacho and Conover (2011) documented evidence of SISBEN manipulation, with individuals misreporting income and assets to qualify for lower SISBEN scores and program eligibility — suggesting gaming of the targeting system.\n\nThe program's long-term impacts on human capital and intergenerational mobility remain unclear. Critics argue that transfers address symptoms of poverty without tackling structural causes — land inequality, labor market informality, and regional disparities in service quality. The emphasis on demand-side conditionalities cannot overcome supply-side failures in education and health service quality.\n\nFiscal sustainability has become a growing concern as the program expanded. What began as a crisis-response measure now represents a significant ongoing fiscal commitment, and political pressure to expand coverage creates challenges for maintaining adequate transfer levels.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- CCT programs designed as crisis responses can become permanent institutions when supported by rigorous evidence of impact\n- Quasi-experimental evaluation partnerships with independent researchers enhance credibility and inform program refinement\n- Early childhood nutrition impacts (under age 2) are among the most valuable outcomes of CCT programs, as they have long-term consequences for cognitive development\n- Proxy means testing (SISBEN) enables targeting at scale but is vulnerable to strategic manipulation by applicants\n- Adapting social protection to conflict contexts requires flexibility in conditionality enforcement while maintaining program integrity\n\n## References\n\n1.
