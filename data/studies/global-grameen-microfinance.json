  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the 1970s, Bangladesh was one of the world's poorest countries, ravaged by the 1971 independence war and the 1974 famine. Muhammad Yunus, an economics professor at Chittagong University, began lending small amounts ($27 total) to 42 women in the village of Jobra in 1976. He observed that tiny loans could enable the poor to invest in income-generating activities, yet formal banks refused to serve them, citing lack of collateral and high transaction costs.\n\nThe conventional banking system systematically excluded the poor. Without access to credit, the poorest households were trapped in cycles of dependency on moneylenders charging exorbitant interest rates, sometimes exceeding 100% annually. Yunus's insight was that the poor were creditworthy if appropriate lending mechanisms could be designed.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nGrameen Bank was formally established as a government-regulated bank in 1983. Its core innovation was group lending: borrowers formed five-member groups that provided mutual support and peer monitoring. Loans were made to individuals, but the group collectively ensured repayment. Weekly repayment meetings created regular accountability, and access to subsequent, larger loans was contingent on group members maintaining good repayment records.\n\nThe model specifically targeted women, who constituted 97% of Grameen's borrowers. Yunus argued that women were more reliable borrowers and that lending to women generated greater welfare benefits for families. Loans started at very small amounts (as little as $10–50) and could increase with successful repayment history.\n\nGrameen's success inspired a global microfinance movement. Organizations like BancoSol in Bolivia, ASA in Bangladesh, and SKS Microfinance in India adapted the model. By the 2000s, microfinance had become one of the most prominent strategies in international development, with dedicated investment vehicles, regulatory frameworks, and massive commercial interest.\n\nThe 2005 UN International Year of Microcredit and Yunus's 2006 Nobel Peace Prize cemented microfinance's status as a leading poverty reduction tool. The movement expanded from credit to broader financial inclusion, incorporating savings, insurance, and mobile money services.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe most rigorous evidence comes from Banerjee et al. (2015), published in the *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, which synthesized six randomized controlled trials across Bosnia, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Mongolia, and Morocco. The landmark study found that microcredit had modest positive effects: it expanded business activity and increased business investment, but did not produce transformative effects on income, consumption, health, education, or women's empowerment within the study timeframes (18–36 months).\n\nEarlier, Morduch (1999) questioned Grameen's claimed 97% repayment rate and the depth of poverty reduction attributed to the bank. His analysis suggested that the poorest borrowers benefited least and that reported repayment rates masked significant refinancing and rescheduling.\n\nPitt and Khandker (1998) had found significant positive effects of Grameen participation on household consumption in Bangladesh, particularly for female borrowers. However, these results were disputed by Roodman and Morduch (2014), who demonstrated that the findings were sensitive to methodological choices and not robust to alternative specifications.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe microfinance sector faced its most severe crisis in Andhra Pradesh, India, in 2010. Aggressive lending practices by commercial microfinance institutions, particularly SKS Microfinance (which had completed a high-profile IPO), led to over-indebtedness among borrowers. A wave of borrower suicides prompted the state government to effectively shut down microfinance operations, triggering mass defaults and an industry-wide reckoning.\n\nBateman (2010), in *Why Doesn't Microfinance Work?*, argued that microfinance was fundamentally limited as a poverty reduction strategy. He contended that small loans financed subsistence activities with little potential for growth, created market saturation, and diverted attention from more structural interventions like industrial policy and public investment.\n\nThe commercialization of microfinance raised additional concerns. Mission drift, in which institutions prioritized profitability over serving the poorest, became widespread. Interest rates of 30–100% annually in some markets raised questions about whether microfinance was genuinely benefiting or exploiting the poor.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Financial inclusion is important for the poor, but credit alone does not reliably lift people out of poverty\n- Group lending can solve information and enforcement problems, but peer pressure can also create harmful social dynamics\n- Commercialization of social enterprises requires careful regulation to prevent mission drift and predatory practices\n- Rigorous impact evaluation often reveals more modest effects than anecdotal success stories suggest\n- Comprehensive financial services (savings, insurance, payments) may matter more than credit alone\n\n## References\n\n1.
