  "content": "## Background\n\nKenya's centralized governance structure, inherited from colonial administration and reinforced by post-independence presidents Kenyatta and Moi, concentrated power and resources in Nairobi. This centralization contributed to ethnic patronage politics, regional inequality, and periodic violence, most devastatingly during the 2007-2008 post-election crisis that killed over 1,100 people and displaced 600,000. The crisis underscored how winner-take-all control of the central state made political competition existentially high-stakes.\n\nPrevious decentralization efforts had been limited and ineffective. The Local Authority system, dating from the Local Government Act of 1977, created elected councils at the district level but gave them minimal revenue and authority. The Constituency Development Fund (CDF), established in 2003, allocated resources to parliamentary constituencies but was controlled by individual MPs and plagued by corruption. Various commissions, including the Bomas Constitutional Conference, had recommended devolution for decades.\n\nThe 2008 Kofi Annan-mediated National Accord, which ended the post-election violence, included agreement on comprehensive constitutional reform. The resulting 2010 Constitution, approved by 67% of voters in a referendum, established a devolved system that represented a fundamental restructuring of Kenyan governance.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe 2010 Constitution created a two-tier government system: a national government and 47 county governments, each led by an elected governor with a county assembly. The design drew on extensive comparative analysis and local consultations. Counties were assigned 14 specific functions including pre-primary education, county health services, county transport, agriculture, county planning, and trade development.\n\nThe fiscal framework guaranteed counties a minimum of 15% of the most recently audited national revenue, distributed through a formula based on population, poverty index, land area, fiscal responsibility, and equal share. An additional Equalization Fund of 0.5% of national revenue was established for historically marginalized areas. The Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) was established to recommend the revenue-sharing formula, while the Controller of Budget was empowered to oversee county spending.\n\nThe Transition Authority managed the transfer of functions, assets, and staff from 2013 to 2016. Over 100,000 former local authority employees were absorbed into county public services. The transition was complex: counties had to establish entirely new administrative structures, recruit senior management, develop county integrated development plans (CIDPs), and set up public financial management systems essentially from scratch.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe World Bank's 2016 Kenya County Budget and Economic Review found that counties had significantly increased investment in local infrastructure, with county development expenditure reaching 30% of total county budgets in some counties. Health services showed notable improvements: a 2018 World Bank assessment documented that the number of health facilities in Kenya increased by over 20% between 2013 and 2017, with the expansion concentrated in previously underserved counties.\n\nD'Arcy and Cornell (2016), writing in the *Journal of Modern African Studies*, found that devolution had begun to shift political incentives, with gubernatorial elections creating local accountability pressures distinct from national politics. Citizen satisfaction data from Afrobarometer surveys showed that approximately 60% of Kenyans supported devolution by 2019, though satisfaction with county service delivery was more mixed. Research by Kimathi (2017) documented improvements in access to health services in rural counties, including increased availability of essential medicines and reduced travel distances to health facilities.\n\nRevenue allocation achieved some redistribution. Previously marginalized counties in northern Kenya—Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit—received per capita allocations significantly above the national average, directing unprecedented resources to areas long neglected by the central government.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCorruption emerged as a dominant concern. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) investigated numerous governors and county officials, and the Auditor General repeatedly flagged irregular expenditure across counties. County wage bills consumed an outsized share of budgets; by 2018, many counties spent over 50% of their budgets on personnel emoluments, well above the 35% legal ceiling. This left insufficient resources for development spending and service delivery.\n\nThe health sector experienced particular disruption during the transition. Doctors, nurses, and clinical officers staged prolonged strikes in 2013 and 2017, partly over confusion about employment terms under devolution. Drug supply chains were disrupted as counties took over procurement from the centralized Kenya Medical Supplies Authority. Tama et al. (2018) documented how the transition created gaps in health commodity availability, particularly in smaller counties with limited procurement capacity. Critics including Nyanjom (2011) cautioned that without adequate capacity building, devolution risked creating 47 smaller sites of corruption and mismanagement rather than a single central one.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Constitutional entrenchment of revenue shares provides fiscal protection**: Kenya's guarantee of at least 15% of national revenue to counties limited the ability of the central government to recentralize through budget manipulation.\n- **Transition management requires sustained institutional support**: The complexity of establishing 47 new governments simultaneously required more capacity building and technical support than was initially provided.\n- **Wage bill management is critical for devolution success**: Without strict enforcement of personnel expenditure ceilings, counties risk consuming their budgets on salaries rather than service delivery.\n- **Health sector devolution needs careful sequencing**: Devolving health services without adequately preparing supply chain, human resource, and quality assurance systems created service disruptions that harmed patients.\n- **Devolution can reduce ethnic conflict incentives**: By creating multiple centers of power and resources, devolution may reduce the zero-sum nature of national politics, though this effect requires sustained institution-building.\n\n## References\n\n- D'Arcy, M. and Cornell, A.
