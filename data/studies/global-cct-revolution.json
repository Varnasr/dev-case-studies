  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the 1990s, Latin America faced persistent poverty alongside growing recognition that traditional social assistance programs were poorly targeted, plagued by corruption, and ineffective at building human capital. In-kind transfers (food distribution, subsidized goods) suffered from high leakage, diversion, and market distortions. Universal subsidies on fuel and food disproportionately benefited middle-class and wealthy households who consumed more.\n\nMexico's experience was particularly instructive. Despite decades of anti-poverty programs, poverty rates remained stubbornly high, particularly in rural and indigenous communities. Educational attainment was low, with many children, especially girls, dropping out before completing secondary school. The country needed a new approach that would simultaneously alleviate immediate poverty and invest in the human capital of the next generation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nProgresa (later renamed Oportunidades, then Prospera), launched in 1997 under President Ernesto Zedillo, introduced a paradigm-shifting approach to social protection. The program provided cash transfers to poor families conditional on children attending school regularly, family members visiting health clinics for preventive care, and pregnant women receiving prenatal check-ups. Crucially, the program was designed from the outset with a rigorous randomized evaluation, with the rollout phased across 506 communities.\n\nThe design reflected a theory of change that poverty persisted partly because poor families underinvested in their children's education and health, whether due to liquidity constraints, imperfect information, or high discount rates. By conditioning cash transfers on human capital investments, CCTs aimed to break intergenerational poverty cycles while providing immediate consumption support.\n\nBrazil's Bolsa Familia, consolidated from earlier programs in 2003 under President Lula, became the world's largest CCT, reaching 14 million families (approximately 50 million people) at its peak. Colombia's Familias en Accion, Honduras's PRAF, and Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social followed. The model spread rapidly beyond Latin America to the Philippines (Pantawid), Indonesia (PKH), Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, and dozens of African countries.\n\nFiszbein and Schady (2009), in the World Bank's definitive report *Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty*, synthesized evidence from across the globe and provided a comprehensive framework for understanding CCT design, implementation, and impact. They concluded that CCTs were effective at increasing school enrollment and health service utilization and that the conditions served both to direct investments toward human capital and to build political support for transfers to the poor.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBaird, Ferreira, Ozler, and Woolcock (2014) conducted a systematic meta-analysis of 75 studies across 52 programs. They found that CCTs increased school enrollment by 5–10 percentage points on average, with larger effects for secondary school enrollment and for girls. The effects on learning outcomes (test scores) were less consistent, suggesting that getting children into school did not automatically improve the quality of education they received.\n\nMexico's Progresa evaluation, one of the most influential in development economics, found that the program increased secondary school enrollment by 7.2–9.3 percentage points for girls and 3.5–5.8 percentage points for boys. Child illness rates fell by 12%, and adult labor supply was not reduced (addressing concerns about dependency). Gertler (2004) found that Progresa improved child health outcomes, with a 25% reduction in illness among 0–5 year olds.\n\nBrazil's Bolsa Familia contributed to a significant decline in poverty and inequality. Between 2003 and 2014, extreme poverty in Brazil fell from 8.4% to 2.5%, and the Gini coefficient declined from 0.59 to 0.52. While multiple factors contributed (minimum wage increases, economic growth), Bolsa Familia was estimated to account for 15–20% of the reduction in inequality.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe central debate in the CCT literature concerns whether conditions are necessary or whether unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) would achieve similar results at lower administrative cost. Baird et al. (2011), in a randomized experiment in Malawi, found that CCTs produced larger school enrollment effects than UCTs but that UCTs had larger effects on reducing teenage pregnancy and marriage, suggesting that conditions might not be beneficial for all outcomes.\n\nAdministrative costs of monitoring conditions can be substantial, particularly in countries with weak institutional capacity. In some programs, enforcement is lax or nominal, raising questions about whether conditions function as behavioral nudges rather than binding constraints. If conditions are not enforced, the distinction between CCTs and UCTs becomes academic.\n\nTargeting challenges persist. Programs must identify the poorest households accurately, and both inclusion errors (non-poor receiving benefits) and exclusion errors (poor households not reached) occur. Proxy means testing, the most common targeting method, is imperfect and can create perverse incentives.\n\nLong-term impact on poverty reduction through human capital accumulation, the core theoretical justification for conditions, remains less well-established. While school enrollment increases are robust, evidence of sustained income gains from additional education in contexts with weak labor markets is more limited.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- CCTs can effectively increase school enrollment and health service utilization among poor households, with rigorous evidence from multiple countries\n- Built-in evaluation from program inception (as with Progresa) creates uniquely valuable evidence and builds political support\n- Conditions may be most valuable for their political economy effects (building support for redistribution) rather than their behavioral effects\n- Increasing school attendance does not guarantee improved learning; complementary investments in education quality are essential\n- Program design must balance targeting accuracy against administrative costs and political sustainability\n\n## References\n\n1.
