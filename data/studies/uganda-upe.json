  "content": "## Background\n\nAt independence in 1962, Uganda had relatively strong educational foundations compared to many Sub-Saharan African countries, but decades of political instability under Idi Amin and the subsequent civil war devastated the education system. By the early 1990s, net primary enrollment rates had fallen to approximately 60%, with significant disparities by gender, region, and income. Families bore the bulk of education costs through school fees, which effectively excluded the poorest children.\n\nDuring the 1996 presidential campaign, Yoweri Museveni made a bold pledge: if elected, his government would provide free primary education for up to four children per family. This promise resonated powerfully with a population for whom school fees represented one of the largest household expenditures. Following Museveni's victory, the government moved rapidly to implement Universal Primary Education (UPE), launching the programme in January 1997.\n\nUganda was among the first countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to abolish primary school fees, predating the broader wave of fee abolition that swept the region in the 2000s. The programme was supported by substantial donor financing, particularly from the World Bank, DFID, and USAID, as well as debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe UPE policy had several core elements. The government abolished all tuition fees and Parent-Teacher Association levies for primary education. It provided capitation grants directly to schools on a per-pupil basis to replace lost fee revenue. The government also invested in school construction, teacher recruitment, and textbook provision, though these investments lagged far behind the surge in enrollment.\n\nThe response was immediate and dramatic. Enrollment jumped from 3.1 million in 1996 to 5.3 million in 1997, an increase of over 70% in a single year. By 2003, enrollment had reached 7.6 million. The surge included large numbers of over-age children who had previously been excluded by fees, as well as first-generation learners from the poorest families. Girls' enrollment saw particularly dramatic gains, with the gross enrollment rate for girls rising from 63% to over 100% (indicating inclusion of over-age students).\n\nThe government also attempted to limit family size enrollment to four children per household in the initial policy, but this restriction proved impossible to enforce and was quietly dropped. In practice, UPE became free primary education for all children.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nDeininger's 2003 study, published in the *World Bank Economic Review*, provided some of the earliest rigorous evidence on UPE's impact. Using household survey data, Deininger found that UPE significantly increased the probability of school attendance among the poorest quintile and substantially reduced the gender gap in enrollment. The programme was strongly progressive, with the largest enrollment gains among the poorest and most disadvantaged children.\n\nHowever, the rapid expansion imposed enormous strains on an already fragile education system. Pupil-teacher ratios soared to 65:1 nationally, with some schools reporting ratios exceeding 100:1. Many classrooms lacked basic supplies, and newly recruited teachers often had minimal qualifications. Multiple studies, including work by Grogan (2009) and Nishimura et al. (2008), documented significant declines in learning outcomes. The Primary Leaving Examination pass rate declined, and learning assessments showed that many children completing primary school had not achieved basic literacy and numeracy.\n\nCompletion rates remained a persistent challenge. By 2005, only about 57% of children who enrolled in Primary 1 were completing Primary 7. Dropout was driven by indirect costs (uniforms, materials, transportation), poor school quality, and household poverty that pulled children into work.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe central tension in Uganda's UPE experience has been between access and quality. The programme succeeded spectacularly in getting children into school but has struggled to ensure that they actually learn. This pattern, sometimes called the \"schooling without learning\" crisis, has become a defining challenge for education systems across the developing world.\n\nCritics have also pointed to the persistence of informal fees charged by schools despite the fee abolition policy, the politicization of the programme, and the neglect of secondary and tertiary education in the rush to universalize primary access. Regional disparities remain significant, with northern Uganda, affected by the Lord's Resistance Army conflict, lagging far behind. Despite these challenges, Uganda's UPE remains one of the most consequential education reforms in African history and influenced fee abolition policies across the continent.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Abolishing school fees can produce rapid and dramatic enrollment gains, particularly among the poorest and most excluded populations.\n- Supply-side investments (teachers, classrooms, materials) must keep pace with demand-side expansion to prevent catastrophic quality declines.\n- Access without learning is an incomplete success; enrollment metrics alone are inadequate measures of education system performance.\n- Political commitment at the highest level can drive rapid policy implementation, but sustainability requires institutional capacity and sustained financing.\n- Gender gaps in enrollment can be substantially reduced through fee abolition, though gender parity in completion and learning outcomes requires additional interventions.\n\n## References\n\n- Deininger, K.
