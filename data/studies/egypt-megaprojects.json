  "content": "## Background\n\nFollowing the July 2013 military-backed removal of President Mohamed Morsi, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi consolidated power and adopted a development model centered on large-scale infrastructure megaprojects. This approach served multiple purposes: demonstrating state capacity, generating employment, rallying nationalist sentiment, and channeling investment through military-affiliated entities. Egypt faced genuine infrastructure deficits: Cairo's 20+ million population strained housing, transportation, and services, and the economy needed investment to recover from the 2011-2013 political turmoil.\n\nThe military's role in the Egyptian economy has deep roots, but expanded dramatically under Sisi. The Armed Forces Engineering Authority (AFEA) and military-linked companies became primary contractors for government projects, operating outside normal procurement, transparency, and accountability frameworks. Adly (2020) documented how this model concentrated economic power while crowding out private sector participation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe New Suez Canal, announced in August 2014, involved dredging a 35 km parallel channel and widening and deepening 37 km of the existing canal to allow two-way transit. Completed in a record one year at a cost of $8.5 billion, financed through investment certificates sold to Egyptian citizens in a nationalistic campaign that raised the full amount in eight days. The project was promoted as doubling canal revenue to $13.2 billion by 2023.\n\nThe New Administrative Capital (NAC), announced in 2015, is a planned city of 700 square kilometers located 45 km east of Cairo. Projected to house 6.5 million residents, it includes a central business district with Africa's tallest tower (385 meters), government ministries (which began relocating in 2023), a presidential palace, diplomatic quarter, and residential zones. Total costs are estimated at $58 billion, financed through a mix of government funds, military investments, and planned real estate sales. The Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), a joint military-housing ministry venture, leads the project.\n\nBeyond these flagship projects, the government constructed over 7,000 km of new roads, a national railway network expansion, multiple new cities (New Alamein, New Galala, the new city of El Mansura), and the Zohr gas field development. Total infrastructure spending exceeded $200 billion between 2014 and 2023.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nSuez Canal revenues did increase, reaching $8 billion in 2022 (boosted partly by supply chain disruptions) before falling to $6.3 billion in 2023. However, revenues fell far short of the projected $13.2 billion, and Marshall (2015) noted early skepticism that expanding capacity would increase revenue when global shipping volumes, not canal capacity, were the binding constraint. The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping in 2024 further reduced canal transit.\n\nThe New Administrative Capital has achieved physical progress, with the government district largely complete and ministries relocating. However, affordability and accessibility concerns are significant: housing prices target upper-middle-class buyers, and public transportation connections to Cairo remain limited. Critics question whether the project addresses Egypt's housing crisis (estimated at 2-3 million unit deficit) or creates a new elite enclave.\n\nAdly (2020) argued that the megaproject model has deepened the military's economic dominance, reduced private sector competitiveness, and accumulated unsustainable debt. Egypt's external debt surged from $46 billion in 2013 to over $165 billion by 2023. Multiple currency devaluations (2016, 2022, 2023, 2024) reflected the macroeconomic strain. An IMF programme in 2022 ($3 billion, later expanded) required commitments to reduce the state's economic footprint.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe central criticism is economic efficiency. Megaprojects absorb enormous capital that could have been invested in education, healthcare, or private-sector enabling infrastructure. The New Administrative Capital's $58 billion cost exceeds Egypt's entire annual health and education budgets combined. The social rate of return on many projects is questionable.\n\nTransparency is severely lacking. Military-led procurement bypasses competitive bidding, and project finances are opaque. Abdelrahman (2017) documented how the military economy operates as a parallel system beyond parliamentary or judicial oversight. Labor conditions on megaprojects, including allegations of forced military conscript labor, have drawn criticism.\n\nThe debt accumulation has created fiscal vulnerability. Debt service consumed approximately 45% of government revenue by 2023, crowding out social spending. The megaproject strategy has not generated sufficient productive capacity or export earnings to service the borrowing, creating reliance on Gulf financial support and IMF lending.\n\nRegional inequality has arguably worsened, with investment concentrated in Cairo, the Suez corridor, and the North Coast while Upper Egypt and rural areas receive proportionally less.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Megaproject-driven development can deliver visible infrastructure but risks misallocating capital relative to social and economic priorities\n- Military-led economic models reduce transparency, crowd out private enterprise, and create accountability deficits\n- Nationalist financing campaigns (investment certificates) can mobilize domestic savings but create obligations that must be serviced from project returns\n- Revenue projections for infrastructure megaprojects are frequently overestimated, especially when demand rather than supply is the binding constraint\n- Debt-financed infrastructure must generate sufficient returns to service borrowing; otherwise, fiscal sustainability is undermined\n- New city projects risk creating elite enclaves rather than addressing housing affordability for the majority population\n\n## References\n\n1.
