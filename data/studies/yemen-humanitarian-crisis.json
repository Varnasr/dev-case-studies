  "content": "## Background\n\nYemen was the poorest country in the Middle East before the conflict. Decades of authoritarian rule under President Ali Abdullah Saleh (1978-2012), rapid population growth, water scarcity (Yemen is one of the most water-stressed countries globally), limited oil revenues (which peaked in the mid-2000s), and weak state institutions created a fragile development context. The Social Fund for Development (SFD), established in 1997 with World Bank support, was one of the few effective development institutions, implementing community-driven projects in health, education, and infrastructure across rural Yemen.\n\nSalisbury (2011) documented the SFD's relatively effective governance model, which operated through local councils and community participation. However, the fund's reach was limited, and underlying structural challenges, including tribal governance, qat cultivation consuming scarce water resources, and a youth bulge with 60% of the population under 25, were beyond its scope.\n\nThe 2011 Arab Spring protests led to Saleh's departure and a political transition under Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. However, the transition process (the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and National Dialogue Conference) collapsed when Houthi forces (Ansar Allah), allied with forces loyal to former president Saleh, seized Sanaa in September 2014 and expanded south. In March 2015, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to restore the Hadi government.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe humanitarian response to Yemen's crisis has been one of the largest and most complex in the world. The UN-coordinated Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan has appealed for $3-4 billion annually since 2017, making it consistently among the largest humanitarian appeals globally. Major responders include WFP (food assistance), UNICEF (nutrition, water, health), WHO (health system support), and UNHCR (displacement).\n\nWFP's emergency food assistance reached approximately 13 million people monthly at peak (2019), delivering grain rations and commodity vouchers. UNICEF supported nutrition treatment for hundreds of thousands of severely malnourished children annually and maintained vaccination campaigns despite the conflict. WHO coordinated the cholera response, which required oral rehydration centers across the country.\n\nThe World Bank, unable to operate directly due to the conflict, established the Yemen Emergency Crisis Response Project, channeling approximately $1.8 billion through UNDP, UNICEF, and WHO for health services, nutrition, cash-for-work, and basic service delivery. This represented an innovative model of multilateral cooperation in an active conflict zone.\n\nCash transfer programmes, building on the pre-conflict Social Welfare Fund, provided emergency payments to approximately 1.5 million households through UNICEF's Emergency Cash Transfer programme, funded primarily by the World Bank.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe humanitarian response prevented outright famine but could not address the underlying crisis. UNDP estimated in 2021 that the conflict had caused approximately 377,000 deaths (direct and indirect), with 60% of deaths attributable to indirect causes including disease, malnutrition, and lack of healthcare. The cholera outbreak that began in 2016 became the largest in modern history, with over 2.5 million suspected cases and approximately 4,000 deaths, driven by the collapse of water and sanitation infrastructure.\n\nFood insecurity reached catastrophic levels. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) repeatedly found areas of Yemen at Phase 4 (Emergency), with pockets at risk of Phase 5 (Famine). By 2023, approximately 17 million Yemenis were food insecure. Child malnutrition rates were among the world's highest, with an estimated 2.2 million children under five acutely malnourished.\n\nThe health system was devastated: approximately half of all health facilities were non-functional due to damage, lack of supplies, or unpaid staff. Health workers went months without salaries. Maternal mortality increased, vaccination coverage dropped, and preventable disease outbreaks (diphtheria, measles) recurred.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nAccess constraints are the primary operational challenge. Both the Houthi-controlled north and the internationally recognized government areas imposed restrictions on humanitarian operations, including bureaucratic impediments, diversion of aid, and interference with needs assessments. The Houthis were repeatedly accused of diverting food aid, and a UN Panel of Experts documented systematic interference.\n\nThe humanitarian response has been criticized for sustaining a war economy rather than building pressure for peace. Aid flows provided resources that conflict parties could tax or divert, potentially prolonging the war. Coordination between humanitarian, development, and peace efforts (the \"triple nexus\") remained aspirational rather than operational.\n\nFunding shortfalls were chronic: the humanitarian response was typically only 50-60% funded, forcing agencies to reduce rations and cut programmes. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, both members of the coalition conducting military operations, were simultaneously among the largest humanitarian donors, creating a contradiction that critics highlighted.\n\nThe SFD, Yemen's pre-conflict development success story, was unable to operate at scale during the war, though it maintained some community-level projects. The institutional capacity built over two decades was largely lost.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Humanitarian response can prevent the worst outcomes (famine, epidemic mortality) but cannot substitute for political resolution of conflict\n- Pre-conflict development investments and institutions (like the SFD) are vulnerable to destruction in protracted conflict, underscoring the need for conflict prevention\n- Cholera and other disease outbreaks are predictable consequences of infrastructure destruction, requiring prepositioned response capacity\n- Cash transfers can maintain purchasing power even in conflict zones when market systems continue functioning\n- Humanitarian access must be negotiated and protected; aid diversion undermines both effectiveness and donor confidence\n- Military coalitions cannot credibly claim humanitarian leadership while conducting operations causing civilian harm\n\n## References\n\n1.
