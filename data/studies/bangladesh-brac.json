A landmark randomized controlled trial published in Science (Banerjee et al., 2015) tested the model across six countries and found sustained income gains of 38% and consumption gains of 5-10% three years after the program ended — one of the most robust results in development economics. BRAC's Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program has reached over 2.1 million households in Bangladesh since 2002 and has been replicated in 50+ countries. The model costs approximately $1,400-$4,500 per household depending on context, making it expensive relative to simple cash transfers but cost-effective given its permanent effects. Verdict: The graduation model represents the most rigorously validated approach to ending extreme poverty, proving that the poorest can escape poverty traps when given a comprehensive, time-limited 'big push' — but scaling it globally remains a funding and institutional challenge.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nIn the early 2000s, Bangladesh had made significant progress against poverty — the headcount rate had fallen from 57% in 1991 to about 49% by 2000. Microfinance, pioneered by Grameen Bank and BRAC itself, had reached tens of millions of borrowers and was widely credited as a key tool. But a troubling pattern had emerged: the poorest of the poor — the 'ultra-poor' — were systematically excluded from and unable to benefit from microfinance.\n\nThe ultra-poor, as defined by BRAC, were households that met several criteria: they were in the bottom income decile, owned less than 10 decimals (0.1 acre) of land, had no productive assets, had adult women who worked as domestic servants or begged for food, had children of working age engaged in paid labor, and had no active male earner in the household. These families — estimated at 10-15% of Bangladesh's rural population, or roughly 8-10 million people — lived below even the extreme poverty line of $1.25/day (2005 PPP).\n\nWhy couldn't microfinance reach them? The evidence was clear: the ultra-poor could not take on debt. They lacked the stable income needed to make weekly repayments, they had no collateral (even social collateral, since they were marginalized from village networks), and the microfinance group lending model — which required peer selection and monitoring — systematically excluded the most destitute. Grameen Bank's own data showed that its borrowers were concentrated in the 20th-60th percentile of the income distribution, not the bottom decile.\n\nThis was a profound challenge to the microfinance orthodoxy that had dominated development thinking since the 1990s. If the tool that had supposedly solved poverty didn't work for the poorest, what would?\n\nFazle Hasan Abed, BRAC's founder, recognized this gap in the late 1990s. Abed, a former Shell Oil executive who had founded BRAC in 1972 to rehabilitate refugees after Bangladesh's Liberation War, had built the organization into a development conglomerate operating health programs, schools, microfinance, and social enterprises serving over 100 million people. But the ultra-poor remained beyond BRAC's reach, and Abed took this as a personal challenge.\n\nThe intellectual foundations for a solution drew from two sources. First, development economists had long theorized about 'poverty traps' — the idea that the very poor face a critical threshold below which they cannot accumulate enough savings or assets to climb out of poverty on their own. Simple transfers — whether cash or assets — might lift people temporarily, but without crossing this threshold, they would fall back. Second, behavioral economics and psychology research suggested that extreme poverty imposed cognitive burdens (stress, decision fatigue, hopelessness) that impaired economic decision-making. Any effective intervention would need to address not just material deprivation but also the psychological dimensions of destitution.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nBRAC launched the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction — Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) program in 2002, initially covering 100,000 households across rural Bangladesh. The program has since been expanded in phases: Phase I (2002-2006) reached 100,000 households, Phase II (2007-2011) reached 600,000 additional households, and subsequent phases brought the total to over 2.1 million households by 2023.\n\nThe program operates through a sequenced, 24-month intervention with the following core components:\n\n**1. Targeting and selection (Month 0):** BRAC uses a three-step process to identify participants. First, participatory wealth ranking at the village level identifies the poorest households. Second, a survey verifies that households meet specific inclusion criteria (food insecurity, lack of productive assets, female household head, etc.). Third, BRAC staff conduct home visits to confirm eligibility and exclude inclusion errors. This targeting process, while labor-intensive, achieves remarkably low leakage — independent evaluations found that 85-90% of selected households were in the bottom quintile.\n\n**2. Asset transfer (Month 1-2):** Each selected household receives a productive asset — typically livestock (cows, goats, or poultry), or inputs for a small enterprise (nursery seedlings, small trade inventory). The asset value in Bangladesh ranges from Tk 9,000-15,000 ($100-180 at the time). Participants choose from a menu of options, with guidance from BRAC staff on what is feasible in their local market context. The most popular choice has been dairy cows (selected by approximately 45% of participants), followed by goat-rearing (25%) and poultry (15%).\n\n**3. Skills training (Months 1-6):** Participants receive intensive hands-on training in managing their chosen asset. For livestock recipients, this includes animal husbandry, veterinary first aid, feeding practices, and milk marketing. BRAC leverages its existing network of community livestock workers and para-veterinarians to provide ongoing technical support. Training sessions are held 2-3 times per week in the initial months.\n\n**4. Consumption stipend (Months 1-12 or 1-18):** Because the ultra-poor cannot afford to wait for their new assets to generate income, participants receive a weekly cash stipend of Tk 70-100 ($0.85-$1.20) per week during the first 12-18 months. This allows households to meet basic food needs without selling the transferred asset — a critical design feature, since distress sale of the asset would undermine the entire program logic.\n\n**5. Savings facilitation (Months 1-24):** BRAC workers visit each household weekly and encourage savings deposits of even tiny amounts (Tk 5-10/week initially). Participants are linked to BRAC's microfinance program, but do not borrow during the program period — savings only. By program end, the median participant had accumulated Tk 3,000-4,000 ($35-50) in savings.\n\n**6. Regular coaching visits (Months 1-24):** This is arguably the program's most distinctive feature. A dedicated BRAC community worker visits each participant weekly throughout the 24-month program. These visits serve multiple functions: technical advice on asset management, encouragement and psychosocial support, health and nutrition counseling, social awareness (rights, government services, legal identity), and monitoring of asset condition and household welfare. Each community worker oversees approximately 20 households, making this an intensive (and expensive) form of support.\n\n**7. Health support (Months 1-24):** Participants receive free basic healthcare through BRAC's community health workers, including prenatal care, child immunization, and treatment for common illnesses. This addresses a frequent cause of poverty relapse — a health shock that forces asset sale.\n\n**8. Social integration (Months 6-24):** In the later phases, BRAC facilitates connections between ultra-poor participants and existing BRAC microfinance groups and village organizations. This builds social capital and provides an ongoing support network after the program ends.\n\nThe total cost per household in Bangladesh was approximately $450-500 in the initial phase (early 2000s), rising to approximately $800-1,000 in later phases due to higher asset values and expanded services. In other countries where the model was replicated, costs were typically higher: $1,400-$4,500 per household.\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe graduation model's theory of change is explicitly designed to overcome poverty traps through a simultaneous 'big push' across multiple dimensions.\n\n**Breaking the asset threshold:** The central hypothesis is that the ultra-poor are trapped below a critical asset level. Below this threshold, any savings or income gains are consumed by day-to-day survival needs, making accumulation impossible. The asset transfer is designed to push households above this threshold in a single step, giving them a productive base from which to generate ongoing income.\n\n**Consumption smoothing during transition:** The weekly stipend addresses the 'hunger gap' — the period between receiving the asset and generating stable income from it. Without the stipend, households would sell the asset to eat, defeating the program's purpose. This addresses a key limitation of pure asset transfer programs, which show high rates of asset disposal among the very poor.\n\n**Human capital and confidence building:** Training and coaching address the knowledge and behavioral dimensions of poverty. The ultra-poor often lack the skills, information, and self-confidence to manage productive assets or engage in markets. Weekly coaching visits build not just technical capacity but also agency — the sense that one can make decisions and influence outcomes. Qualitative research by Hashemi and de Montesquiou (2011) found that participants frequently cited the psychological impact of coaching visits as the most valued program component.\n\n**Health protection as insurance:** Health shocks are the single most common trigger of poverty relapse. By providing basic healthcare, the program acts as informal insurance, protecting the asset base from being liquidated to pay for medical emergencies.\n\n**Savings habit formation:** The savings component creates a buffer stock and instills a habit of financial management. Small savings accumulated over 24 months become the household's first financial reserve — a critical vulnerability reducer.\n\n**Social capital restoration:** The ultra-poor are often socially marginalized — excluded from community organizations, unable to participate in reciprocal labor or gift exchange, and stigmatized. By gradually integrating participants into BRAC groups and village organizations, the program rebuilds social capital, which serves as informal insurance and provides access to information and opportunities.\n\nThe genius of the graduation model is that it bundles all these components together, recognizing that the ultra-poor face multiple, simultaneous constraints. Addressing any single constraint (say, providing only an asset, or only training) is unlikely to work because the other constraints will undermine it. The bundle is designed to be temporary (24 months) and to create self-sustaining improvements that persist after the program ends.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\n**The landmark six-country RCT (Banerjee et al., 2015):** The most important piece of evidence on the graduation model is the randomized controlled trial conducted by Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Nathanael Goldberg, Dean Karlan, Robert Osei, William Pariente, Jeremy Shapiro, Bram Thuysbaert, and Christopher Udry, published in *Science* in May 2015. The study tested BRAC-style graduation programs in six countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru. A total of 10,495 households were studied.\n\nKey findings at the 3-year mark (one year after the program ended):\n- Per capita consumption increased by 5.8% on average across all six sites\n- Household assets increased by 15% (in PPP terms)\n- Food security improved significantly: a 7.2 percentage-point increase in food sufficiency\n- Total income increased by 38% (primarily from the transferred asset and related activities)\n- Time spent in productive activities increased by 17%\n- Mental health improved: depression indicators decreased by 8%\n- Savings increased 96% from baseline\n\nCritically, these effects were *sustained* — they persisted and in some cases grew after the program ended, suggesting that participants had indeed crossed an asset threshold and were on a self-sustaining growth trajectory. The study found positive effects in all six countries despite vastly different contexts, strengthening the claim that the model is generalizable.\n\n**BRAC Bangladesh results (long-term follow-up):** Within Bangladesh, the evidence is even more extensive. A study by Bandiera et al. (2017) published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* followed BRAC TUP participants for 7 years after enrollment (4 years after the program ended). They found:\n- Annual earnings increased by 37% relative to the comparison group, and this gain was *growing over time*\n- Participants had diversified into multiple income sources, reducing vulnerability\n- Land access increased by 0.5 decimals on average (modest but significant for the landless)\n- Household food expenditure increased by 10%\n- 80% of TUP participants had 'graduated' — meeting criteria for sustained poverty exit\n- The program generated a rate of return of approximately 8% annually, meaning it was cost-effective even from a purely economic perspective\n\n**Cost-effectiveness comparisons:** The graduation model costs more per household than unconditional cash transfers ($450-$4,500 vs. $200-$1,000 for typical cash transfer programs). However, proponents argue that the comparison is misleading because graduation effects are permanent while cash transfer effects in many studies dissipate after transfers end. Banerjee et al.'s own cost-benefit analysis found that the program generated $5.38 in benefits (in NPV terms) for every $1 spent in India, and $1.98 per dollar in Ethiopia — the two poorest country sites.\n\n**Global replication:** By 2023, graduation-style programs had been adopted or piloted in over 50 countries. The World Bank, UNHCR, USAID, and multiple governments had incorporated graduation components into their social protection systems. The Government of Bangladesh itself adopted a government-run version (the National Social Security Strategy) incorporating graduation principles. However, government-run versions have generally shown weaker results than BRAC's own implementation, suggesting that institutional capacity and implementation quality matter enormously.\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**The 20% who didn't graduate.** Even in BRAC's own programs, roughly 20% of participants did not achieve sustained poverty exit after 24 months. Research into why reveals sobering patterns: chronic illness (particularly of the household head), disability, extreme old age, repeated natural disasters (flooding is endemic in Bangladesh), and domestic violence were the most common reasons for non-graduation. The model struggles with households facing structural barriers that a 24-month economic intervention cannot resolve.\n\n**Scaling dilution.** As the program expanded from 100,000 to 2.1 million households, concerns about quality dilution emerged. The coaching visits — the most expensive and arguably most important component — were frequently shortened from the intended 30-45 minutes to 10-15 minutes as community workers' caseloads increased. Staff turnover increased as the program expanded into remote areas. A 2018 internal BRAC assessment found that Phase III and IV cohorts showed 10-15% lower graduation rates than Phase I, suggesting implementation quality had declined.\n\n**Asset choice limitations.** The heavy reliance on livestock (dairy cows in particular) created problems. Livestock are vulnerable to disease, flood, and drought. In 2007, Cyclone Sidr killed an estimated 20-30% of TUP-transferred livestock in affected areas. Moreover, the dairy market in many rural areas is thin — flooding the market with milk from thousands of new dairy cow owners depressed prices in some villages. Later program phases introduced more diversified asset options, but livestock remained dominant.\n\n**Gender dynamics were complicated.** The program targets women as household heads, and assets are transferred to women. However, research by Das and Misha (2010) found that in 25-30% of households, male family members (husbands, sons, in-laws) effectively controlled the transferred assets. The program's gender empowerment effects, while real, were mediated by existing household power dynamics that 24 months of coaching could not fully overcome.\n\n**Government adoption has been weaker.** When governments attempted to replicate the model without BRAC's institutional infrastructure, results were significantly worse. Government programs in other countries (and within Bangladesh's own NSSS) faced challenges: targeting was less precise (political pressure to include non-poor households), coaching visits were less frequent and less skilled, and asset procurement was plagued by corruption (suppliers providing lower-quality animals at inflated prices). A World Bank review of government-run graduation pilots in 8 countries found average graduation rates of 55-65%, compared to BRAC's 80%.\n\n**Cost remains a barrier to global scale.** At $450-$4,500 per household, reaching the estimated 700 million people living in extreme poverty globally would cost $150-$300 billion — roughly 2-4 times the total global foreign aid budget. While the model is cost-effective at the per-household level, the absolute scale of funding required is daunting. Critics argue that simpler interventions (cash transfers, public works programs) can reach far more people at lower per-unit cost, even if effects are less permanent.\n\n**BRAC vs. Grameen — an unresolved debate.** Muhammad Yunus and the microfinance community have pushed back against the implication that microfinance 'failed' the ultra-poor. Grameen argues that its own programs for the extreme poor (Grameen's 'struggling members' program) achieve comparable results at lower cost. The empirical evidence favors the graduation model, but the institutional rivalry has sometimes clouded policy discussions.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. The ultra-poor need grants, not loans.** The graduation model's most fundamental insight is that the poorest cannot take on debt. Starting with a grant (asset transfer) rather than a loan is not charity — it is an investment that generates measurable, sustained returns. Social protection systems should not assume that microfinance is a universal solution.\n\n**2. Bundling works when targeting the poorest.** Single-intervention approaches (just cash, just training, just assets) show weaker effects for the ultra-poor than comprehensive packages. The evidence supports the poverty trap theory: multiple simultaneous constraints must be addressed simultaneously. This is expensive, but for the bottom 10-15%, cheaper interventions simply do not produce lasting change.\n\n**3. Implementation quality is everything.** The gap between BRAC's results and government-run replications demonstrates that program design is necessary but not sufficient. The frequency and quality of coaching visits, the precision of targeting, and the integrity of asset procurement all determine outcomes. Governments seeking to adopt graduation models should invest heavily in building implementation capacity — or partner with high-quality NGOs.\n\n**4. Plan for the 20% who don't graduate.** No anti-poverty program achieves 100% success. The graduation model should be embedded within a broader social protection system that provides ongoing support (disability benefits, old-age pensions, health insurance) for those who cannot achieve economic independence. Treating graduation as a standalone solution risks abandoning the most vulnerable.\n\n**5. Rigorous evidence matters for policy adoption.** The Banerjee et al. (2015) RCT was decisive in moving the graduation model from an NGO innovation to a global policy tool. The study's publication in *Science* — and the Nobel Prizes subsequently awarded to Banerjee and Duflo — gave the model credibility with finance ministries and donors that years of program reports had not. Investing in rigorous evaluation accelerates policy adoption.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value | Year/Period | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total BRAC TUP participants (Bangladesh) | 2.1 million households | 2002-2023 | BRAC |\n| Graduation rate (BRAC Bangladesh) | ~80% | Across phases | Bandiera et al.

But grants are expensive and create potential dependency concerns. Under what conditions should governments prioritize grant-based graduation programs over cash transfers or subsidized credit? How would you design a targeting system to distinguish between those who need grants and those who can benefit from loans?\n\n2. **Implementation vs. design:** The gap between BRAC-run and government-run graduation programs suggests that 'how' matters as much as 'what.' What specific features of BRAC's institutional culture and management systems enable higher-quality implementation? Can these be transferred to government bureaucracies, or should governments contract NGOs to deliver graduation programs?\n\n3. **The ethics of experimentation on the ultra-poor:** The Banerjee et al. RCT randomly assigned some ultra-poor households to treatment and others to control groups, meaning some of the world's most destitute people were deliberately excluded from a life-changing intervention for the purpose of research. Was this ethical? How should we weigh the knowledge gains from RCTs against the immediate welfare costs to control groups? Could the same evidence have been generated through non-experimental methods?"
