  "content": "## Background\n\nSouth Africa has faced persistently high unemployment since the end of apartheid, with the official unemployment rate hovering around 25-30% and the expanded rate (including discouraged workers) exceeding 40%. Youth unemployment has been particularly acute, with over 60% of young people aged 15-34 not in employment, education, or training. The structural nature of unemployment, driven by the legacy of apartheid education, spatial inequality, and a capital-intensive economy, has made job creation one of the most intractable challenges facing the post-apartheid state.\n\nPublic works programmes have a long history in South Africa and globally as a tool for providing temporary employment during periods of high unemployment. Drawing on international experience from India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and other programmes, the South African government launched the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) in 2004 as a key component of its strategy to address unemployment and poverty.\n\nThe EPWP was designed as a nationwide programme that would use public expenditure to create temporary work opportunities while simultaneously delivering public goods and services. It was conceived not as a solution to structural unemployment but as a mechanism to provide income relief and work experience to the most vulnerable segments of the population.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe EPWP operates across four sectors. The Infrastructure Sector creates employment through labour-intensive construction and maintenance of roads, buildings, and other public infrastructure, mandating that a minimum proportion of project budgets be spent on labour. The Environment and Culture Sector includes programmes like Working for Water (clearing invasive alien plants), Working on Fire (community-based fire management), and Working for Wetlands. The Social Sector employs community members in home-based care, early childhood development, and community safety programmes. The Non-State Sector channels funding through non-profit organizations and community organizations for public benefit work.\n\nThe Community Works Programme (CWP), introduced in 2010, represented an important innovation. Unlike the project-based employment of the main EPWP, the CWP provided regular part-time work (two days per week) to participants in designated sites, offering a more predictable income stream. Participants identified useful work in their communities, including food gardens, school maintenance, and care services.\n\nThe EPWP set progressively ambitious targets across its phases. Phase I (2004-2009) aimed to create 1 million work opportunities. Phase II (2009-2014) targeted 4.5 million. Phase III (2014-2019) raised the target to 6 million. The programme was managed by the Department of Public Works and coordinated across all spheres of government.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nIn quantitative terms, the EPWP has achieved substantial scale. By 2019, the programme reported creating over 9.8 million cumulative work opportunities across all four sectors and all three phases. The Infrastructure Sector was the largest employer, followed by the Environment and Social Sectors. The programme successfully channelled employment opportunities to target groups: women constituted approximately 60% of participants, youth about 40%, and persons with disabilities about 2%.\n\nHowever, the quality and impact of these work opportunities have been questioned. McCord (2004), in research conducted for the Southern African Labour and Development Research Unit, provided an early critique arguing that the EPWP work opportunities were too short (averaging 80-100 days) and too poorly paid to meaningfully address chronic poverty. She argued that the programme's design reflected a misdiagnosis of South African unemployment as a cyclical rather than structural phenomenon.\n\nPhilip (2013) found that the CWP model showed more promise than the main EPWP because its regular, ongoing nature provided a predictable income floor and the community-identified work was often more socially valued. However, the CWP reached only a fraction of the unemployed population and faced questions about whether it constituted a back-door basic income guarantee rather than a genuine employment programme.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe most fundamental criticism of the EPWP is that it creates temporary work opportunities rather than sustainable employment. The average duration of an EPWP work opportunity is approximately 80-100 days, after which participants return to unemployment. There is limited evidence that EPWP experience significantly improves participants' prospects of finding regular employment, partly because the skills acquired (manual labour, basic services) do not match the requirements of the formal economy.\n\nMinimum wage debates have been contentious. The EPWP initially operated below the national minimum wage, justified as necessary to employ more people. Critics argued this institutionalized poverty-level wages. Administrative challenges, including late payments to participants, poor targeting, and the counting of very short-term engagements as \"work opportunities\" to meet targets, have undermined the programme's credibility. The gap between the number of work opportunities reported and the actual full-time equivalent employment created is significant.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Public works programmes can deliver temporary income relief at scale but are not a substitute for structural solutions to unemployment.\n- Short-duration work opportunities have limited impact on chronic poverty; regular, predictable employment models (like the CWP) offer more meaningful support.\n- Labour-intensive methods for public infrastructure and services can simultaneously address employment and service delivery needs, but require careful design.\n- Counting \"work opportunities\" rather than full-time equivalent employment can obscure the true scale and impact of public works programmes.\n- In contexts of structural mass unemployment, public works programmes need to be combined with broader industrial policy, education reform, and economic restructuring.\n\n## References\n\n- McCord, A.
