  "content": "## Background\n\nThe eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced decades of armed conflict, with over 5 million deaths attributed to the broader conflict since 1998. The region is extraordinarily rich in minerals, including cassiterite (tin ore), coltan (tantalum ore), wolframite (tungsten ore), and gold, collectively known as 3TG minerals. Armed groups, including the FDLR, various Mai-Mai militias, and elements of the Congolese army (FARDC), have financed their operations through control of mining sites and taxation of mineral trade routes, creating what the UN Group of Experts termed a \"conflict minerals\" economy.\n\nThe linkage between mineral extraction and armed violence attracted international attention through UN expert panel reports and advocacy campaigns by organizations including Global Witness and the Enough Project. These campaigns drew parallels with \"blood diamonds\" in Sierra Leone and called for supply chain regulation to cut the financial lifelines of armed groups. The advocacy ultimately influenced the inclusion of Section 1502 in the broader Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\n\nThe artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector in eastern DRC employs an estimated 500,000 to 2 million people directly, with millions more dependent on mining-related economic activity. For many communities in North and South Kivu, Maniema, and Katanga provinces, artisanal mining is the primary livelihood in the absence of viable agricultural alternatives or formal employment. This dependence on mining made the livelihoods implications of any regulation critically important.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nSection 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act required companies listed on US stock exchanges to conduct due diligence on their supply chains and publicly disclose whether their products contained 3TG minerals originating from the DRC or adjoining countries. The SEC finalized implementing rules in 2012, with the first company filings required in 2014. Companies were required to file annual conflict minerals reports describing their due diligence efforts and the origin of minerals in their products.\n\nOn the ground in the DRC, the primary implementation mechanism was the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (ITSCI), a joint programme of the International Tin Association and the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center. ITSCI established a bagging and tagging system at mine sites, creating a chain of custody documentation from mine to smelter. By 2020, ITSCI had tagged over 2,700 mine sites across the DRC and neighboring countries, providing traceability for tin and tantalum supply chains.\n\nComplementing ITSCI, the Certified Trading Chains (CTC) programme developed by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) provided certification for responsible sourcing. The OECD also developed Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, which became the international standard referenced by the Dodd-Frank legislation and later by the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation adopted in 2017.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe evidence on the effectiveness of conflict minerals regulation is genuinely mixed. Parker, Foltz, and Elsea (2016) used a difference-in-differences approach to examine the impact of Dodd-Frank on conflict in the DRC, finding a statistically significant reduction in battles and violence at mining sites for the regulated 3T minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten) compared to gold, which proved much harder to trace. They estimated a 15% reduction in conflict incidents at 3T mining locations.\n\nHowever, Stoop, Verpoorten, and van der Windt (2018) found significant unintended consequences. Their research documented that the initial implementation of Dodd-Frank created a de facto embargo on Congolese minerals, as international buyers avoided DRC-sourced minerals entirely rather than investing in due diligence. This embargo devastated artisanal mining communities, with miners losing their primary income source. Stoop et al. also found evidence that armed groups shifted their activities, including to gold mining (which is harder to trace) and to other forms of extortion and taxation of civilian populations.\n\nThe Enough Project's 2014 assessment claimed progress, noting that the proportion of tin and tantalum mines in eastern DRC influenced by armed groups had declined. However, Cuvelier et al. (2014) cautioned that the apparent decline in armed group presence at regulated mine sites partly reflected displacement rather than elimination of armed group financing. Gold, which accounts for the majority of mineral revenue but is easily smuggled, remained largely outside the traceability system, with an estimated 98% of artisanal gold leaving the DRC through informal channels.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe conflict minerals framework has been criticized from multiple directions. Development economists and anthropologists including Geenen (2012) and Vogel and Raeymaekers (2016) argued that the legislation imposed a simplistic narrative of \"conflict minerals\" on complex local realities where mining, conflict, and governance intersect in nuanced ways. The framing of minerals as inherently linked to violence stigmatized all Congolese mineral production, harming legitimate miners and traders.\n\nThe compliance costs of due diligence have been substantial, estimated at billions of dollars across the thousands of companies required to file. Critics questioned whether this expenditure produced proportionate benefits, particularly given the shift of armed group activities to unregulated commodities and activities. The Trump administration in 2017 suspended SEC enforcement of Section 1502, creating regulatory uncertainty, though many companies continued voluntary compliance due to reputational concerns and the parallel EU regulation.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Supply chain regulation can reduce armed group presence at specific mine sites but may displace rather than eliminate illicit financing, particularly when valuable minerals like gold remain difficult to trace.\n- De facto embargoes resulting from risk-averse corporate behavior can devastate artisanal mining livelihoods, harming the very populations the regulation intended to protect.\n- Effective conflict minerals policy requires complementary investments in governance, alternative livelihoods, and formalization of artisanal mining rather than relying solely on supply chain transparency.\n- International regulation designed in Washington or Brussels must account for ground-level realities in producing countries, including the complex relationships between mining, conflict, and civilian livelihoods.\n- Traceability systems like ITSCI can create supply chain transparency but face challenges of cost, coverage, fraud, and the exclusion of marginalized miners unable to access certified supply chains.\n\n## References\n\n- Parker, D.
