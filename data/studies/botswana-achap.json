  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the late 1990s, Botswana faced one of the most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. Adult prevalence reached an estimated 37.3% in 2000, meaning that more than one in three adults was HIV-positive. The epidemic was devastating a country that had been one of Africa's great development success stories. Life expectancy, which had risen to approximately 65 years by the early 1990s, plummeted to around 49 years by 2002. The epidemic threatened to reverse decades of gains in health, education, and economic development.\n\nBotswana's relatively high income and small population (approximately 1.7 million at the time) gave it financial and administrative advantages that most affected African countries lacked. However, the scale of the epidemic overwhelmed existing health system capacity. In 2000, antiretroviral therapy (ART) was available in wealthy countries but remained largely inaccessible in Africa due to costs exceeding $10,000 per patient per year and limited health infrastructure for drug delivery.\n\nPresident Festus Mogae declared HIV/AIDS a national emergency and made the fight against the epidemic the government's top priority, committing to provide ART to all who needed it. This was an audacious commitment at a time when no African country had established a national ART programme.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nIn July 2000, the Government of Botswana, the Merck Company Foundation (the philanthropic arm of Merck & Co.), and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation formed the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP). Merck committed $56.5 million over five years (later extended) and donated its antiretroviral drugs (efavirenz and others) free of charge. The Gates Foundation committed $50 million. The government provided health system infrastructure, personnel, and ongoing financing.\n\nThe MASA (\"new dawn\" in Setswana) national antiretroviral treatment programme was launched in January 2002, making Botswana the first African country to provide free public-sector ART. The programme initially focused on four sites but rapidly expanded to over 30 treatment centres across the country. ACHAP supported the scale-up by funding laboratory infrastructure, training health workers, establishing supply chain systems, and developing monitoring and evaluation capacity.\n\nBeyond treatment, ACHAP and the government invested in prevention, including a national routine HIV testing programme (2004), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services, male circumcision, and behaviour change communication. Botswana was among the first African countries to adopt routine \"opt-out\" HIV testing, dramatically increasing the proportion of the population that knew their HIV status.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe results were transformative. By 2013, over 200,000 people were receiving ART through the MASA programme, representing approximately 84% of those eligible under existing treatment guidelines. This was among the highest coverage rates in Africa. Mother-to-child HIV transmission was reduced to below 3%, approaching the levels seen in high-income countries. New HIV infections declined substantially, and AIDS-related mortality fell sharply.\n\nLife expectancy recovered dramatically, rising from approximately 49 years in 2002 to 69 years by 2018, a recovery attributable primarily to the scale-up of ART. Stoneburner, Carballo, Bernstein, and Low-Beer (2003) documented early evidence of behaviour change in Botswana, including increased condom use and partner reduction, contributing to declining incidence alongside biomedical interventions.\n\nThe public-private partnership model pioneered by ACHAP demonstrated that large-scale ART delivery was feasible in African settings, challenging the prevailing scepticism that had argued African health systems were too weak to manage complex antiretroviral regimens. Botswana's experience directly influenced the design of PEPFAR (the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite its achievements, Botswana's HIV/AIDS response faced significant challenges. The financial sustainability of universal free ART remains a concern, as treatment is a lifelong commitment for each patient. As diamond revenues fluctuate and the number of patients on treatment grows, the fiscal burden increases. Some analysts have questioned whether the emphasis on treatment came at the expense of prevention efforts, given that new infections, while declining, continued at significant levels.\n\nThe routine testing programme raised ethical concerns about consent and confidentiality, though studies generally found high levels of public acceptance. Health workforce constraints persisted, with Botswana relying heavily on expatriate doctors and nurses. After ACHAP's formal conclusion in 2014, the government assumed full financial responsibility for the treatment programme, an ongoing commitment that consumes a significant share of health spending.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Public-private partnerships can mobilize complementary resources, with government providing infrastructure and legitimacy, and private partners providing financing, drugs, and technical expertise.\n- National ART scale-up is feasible in African settings with sufficient political commitment, health system investment, and external support.\n- Routine \"opt-out\" HIV testing can dramatically increase diagnosis rates and is generally well-accepted by populations.\n- Treatment and prevention must be pursued simultaneously; treatment alone cannot end an epidemic.\n- Sustainability planning must be embedded in programme design from the outset, particularly for interventions requiring lifelong commitment.\n\n## References\n\n- Stoneburner, R., Carballo, M., Bernstein, R., & Low-Beer, D.
