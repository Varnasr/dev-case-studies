However, this aggregate success masked profound inequality. Van de Walle and Gunewardena (2001), in an influential World Bank study, demonstrated that the benefits of growth were distributed highly unevenly across ethnic groups. While the Kinh majority and Chinese minority (together comprising 86% of the population) experienced dramatic poverty reduction, the country's 53 officially recognized ethnic minorities, concentrated in remote northern and central highlands, lagged far behind.\n\nBy the late 1990s, ethnic minorities constituted roughly 14% of Vietnam's population but accounted for a disproportionate and growing share of the country's poor. Geographic isolation, limited access to markets and services, linguistic barriers (many minority groups do not speak Vietnamese as a primary language), lower educational attainment, and cultural differences in agricultural practices all contributed to persistent poverty. The poverty rate among ethnic minorities remained above 50% in the early 2000s even as the national rate continued declining.\n\nThis growing disparity threatened both social cohesion and the government's legitimacy, particularly in strategically sensitive border regions where many ethnic minorities reside. The recognition that broad-based growth was insufficient to reach the most marginalized populations prompted the development of targeted programs.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nProgramme 135, officially the Programme for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Difficulties in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, was launched in 1998 and has been implemented in three phases. Phase I (1998-2005) focused on basic infrastructure in the approximately 2,400 poorest communes: roads, small-scale irrigation, schools, health stations, clean water systems, and electricity. Phase II (2006-2010) expanded to include livelihood support, capacity building for local officials, and legal aid. Phase III (2012-2020) further broadened the scope to include production support and community-based development.\n\nThe programme was complemented by Programme 30a (2008), which targeted the 64 poorest districts with additional investment in infrastructure, education, and agricultural extension. Together, these programmes constituted the National Targeted Programme for Poverty Reduction, which received substantial funding from the national budget supplemented by international donors including the World Bank, UNDP, and bilateral agencies.\n\nBaulch et al. (2010) conducted one of the most rigorous analyses of Vietnam's ethnic poverty gap, finding that differences in observable characteristics (education, location, land holdings) explained only about half the gap, suggesting that discrimination, cultural factors, and unmeasured disadvantages also played significant roles. This finding had important implications for programme design, suggesting that infrastructure and economic inputs alone would be insufficient.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe targeted programmes achieved measurable improvements in infrastructure and service access. By the end of Phase II, the share of Programme 135 communes with road access increased substantially, and access to clean water, electricity, and health services expanded significantly. School enrollment among ethnic minority children improved, and maternal mortality rates in targeted areas declined.\n\nHowever, the poverty gap between the Kinh majority and ethnic minorities has proved stubbornly persistent. While ethnic minority poverty rates declined from over 50% in the early 2000s to approximately 22.5% by 2019, the Kinh poverty rate fell to approximately 2.5% over the same period. The ratio of ethnic minority to Kinh poverty rates actually widened over time, suggesting that while absolute conditions improved, relative inequality increased. World Bank analysis (2012) found that ethnic minorities accounted for approximately 47% of Vietnam's poor by 2010, up from roughly 29% in 1998, despite being only 14% of the population.\n\nImpact evaluations produced mixed results regarding programme effectiveness. Van de Walle and Mu (2007) found that Programme 135 infrastructure investments generated positive but modest returns, with road construction showing the strongest impact on poverty reduction. However, the targeting of communes rather than households meant that benefits often accrued disproportionately to better-off households within targeted areas.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe programmes have faced several structural challenges. Decentralized implementation has led to significant variation in quality and effectiveness across provinces and communes. Local government capacity in ethnic minority areas is often limited, with under-trained staff, weak financial management, and limited ability to design locally appropriate interventions. The top-down nature of programme design has been criticized for insufficient consultation with minority communities regarding their priorities and needs.\n\nCultural sensitivity remains a challenge. Programmes have sometimes promoted agricultural techniques or livelihood models that conflict with ethnic minority practices without adequate adaptation. Language barriers impede service delivery and community participation. Land rights are a particular concern, as ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected by land acquisition for infrastructure projects and commercial agriculture, sometimes undermining the very livelihoods that poverty programmes seek to support.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Broad-based economic growth, while necessary, is insufficient to reach geographically isolated and socially marginalized populations, requiring targeted interventions.\n- Ethnic and cultural dimensions of poverty require culturally sensitive programme design, including attention to language, customs, and community decision-making processes.\n- Infrastructure investment in remote areas generates positive returns but must be complemented by livelihood support, education, and institutional development.\n- Commune-level targeting can miss intra-community inequality; household-level targeting, while more costly, can improve programme effectiveness.\n- Persistent poverty gaps suggest that structural factors including discrimination and unequal power relations must be addressed alongside material deprivation.\n\n## References\n\n- Van de Walle, D., & Gunewardena, D.
