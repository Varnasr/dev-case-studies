  "content": "## Background\n\nEritrea gained formal independence from Ethiopia in 1993 following a 30-year liberation war (1961-1991) that is among the longest in African history. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which led the armed struggle, transformed into the ruling People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) under President Isaias Afwerki. The liberation war had forged a strong sense of national identity and self-reliance, but also a militarized political culture that would profoundly shape post-independence governance.\n\nNational service was initially conceived as a nation-building institution. Proclamation 82/1995 established compulsory service for all citizens aged 18-40, with an initial period of six months of military training followed by twelve months of active service in military or civilian development activities. The program was modeled partly on the Israeli system and was intended to forge national unity across Eritrea's nine ethnic groups, provide skills training, and contribute to post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe devastating 1998-2000 border war with Ethiopia fundamentally altered the national service program. The conflict killed an estimated 70,000-100,000 people on both sides and ended in a stalemate that left the border question unresolved. President Isaias used the continued state of \"no war, no peace\" to justify extending national service indefinitely, with the Warsai-Yikealo Development Campaign (WDYC) proclaimed in 2002 removing any time limit on service. What had been an 18-month civic duty became an open-ended system of state-directed labor.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe national service system operates as the primary mechanism through which the Eritrean government mobilizes labor for both military deployment and civilian economic activities. Conscripts are assigned to military units, government ministries, state-owned enterprises, or construction projects at the government's discretion. Monthly pay for conscripts is approximately 500 Nakfa (roughly US$33 at official exchange rates), far below what would be needed to support a family, effectively constituting forced labor.\n\nThe government has deployed national service conscripts on large-scale infrastructure projects including road construction, dam building, terracing for soil conservation, and building construction. The Eritrean government argues that national service has been essential for infrastructure development in the absence of sufficient government revenue or foreign investment. Eritrea's road network, water infrastructure, and public buildings have been substantially constructed using conscript labor, enabling infrastructure development at costs far below what would be required using paid labor and contractors.\n\nThe Sawa military training center, where all secondary school students complete their final year of schooling and begin military training, serves as the intake point for national service. This system effectively means that education and conscription are intertwined, with students unable to complete secondary education without entering the military system. Kibreab (2009) analyzed how this linkage between education and conscription created a system from which exit was nearly impossible without fleeing the country.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe Eritrean government claims that national service has produced tangible development outcomes, including the construction of dams, roads, housing, and the transformation of formerly barren hillsides through terracing. Eritrea's infrastructure investment per capita, while difficult to verify independently due to data opacity, appears significant relative to the country's income level. The country has also achieved notable health improvements, including a decline in malaria mortality, improved vaccination coverage, and progress toward millennium development goals, though the extent to which national service contributed versus other factors is debated.\n\nThe UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea (2015) conducted extensive investigations, including interviews with over 550 witnesses, and concluded that the national service system amounted to enslavement. The Commission found systematic patterns of arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence against female conscripts, forced labor, and the absence of any legal recourse for conscripts. In its 2016 follow-up report, the Commission concluded that these abuses constituted crimes against humanity, a finding the Eritrean government categorically rejected.\n\nThe mass exodus of Eritreans constitutes perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the system's impact. UNHCR data showed approximately 507,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers globally by 2019, representing roughly 14% of the total population. Hepner (2009) documented the transnational networks through which Eritreans fled, the dangers of irregular migration routes through Sudan and Libya, and the devastating impact on families and communities. Eritrea has one of the highest per-capita refugee flows in the world, with national service universally cited as the primary driver.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe national service system has generated international condemnation and debate about the boundaries of state-directed development. Defenders, including the Eritrean government and some diaspora supporters, argue that indefinite service was necessitated by Ethiopia's refusal to implement the 2002 Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission ruling and that the program has built national infrastructure and cohesion in a context where Eritrea faced an existential security threat. They point to Eritrea's progress on health indicators and infrastructure despite receiving virtually no international development assistance after the early 2000s.\n\nCritics, including the UN Commission, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, counter that the system cannot be justified by security concerns alone, given its scale, duration, and the systematic abuses documented by multiple independent investigations. The economic impact of mass emigration has been severe, depriving Eritrea of its most educated and productive young adults. The government has attempted to capture diaspora resources through a controversial 2% income tax on Eritreans abroad, further illustrating the complex relationship between the national service system, emigration, and the political economy of the diaspora.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- National service programs can produce infrastructure and build national identity in post-conflict settings, but indefinite conscription transforms civic duty into forced labor with devastating human rights and demographic consequences.\n- The security justification for open-ended conscription, while initially credible given the unresolved border conflict, has diminished in the face of the 2018 peace agreement with Ethiopia, yet the system persists, suggesting its real function is political control.\n- Mass emigration driven by oppressive policies creates brain drain that undermines the very development the policies purport to serve, creating a self-defeating cycle.\n- International naming and shaming through UN investigations and human rights reporting has not materially altered Eritrea's policies, raising questions about the effectiveness of international human rights mechanisms absent enforcement capacity.\n- The Eritrean case illustrates the false dichotomy between development and human rights: sustainable development requires institutions that respect individual freedoms and generate voluntary participation.\n\n## References\n\n- UN Human Rights Council (2015). *Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea*.
