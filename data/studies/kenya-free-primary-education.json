  "content": "## Background\n\nKenya had first attempted free primary education (FPE) in 1974 under President Jomo Kenyatta, but the policy was not sustained as costs grew. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, structural adjustment programmes led to the introduction of cost-sharing policies that required families to pay school fees and contribute to building funds. By the late 1990s, direct and indirect schooling costs represented a significant barrier to education access, particularly for the poorest households.\n\nThe 2000 Dakar Framework for Action and the Millennium Development Goals created international momentum for universal primary education. Kenya's 2002 presidential election saw the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) under Mwai Kibaki make free primary education a central campaign promise. Upon winning, the new government moved quickly to fulfill this pledge.\n\nPre-intervention data showed stark inequalities. The Demographic and Health Surveys from 2003 indicated that primary school attendance among children from the poorest quintile was roughly 30 percentage points lower than among the wealthiest quintile. Regional disparities were also severe, with arid and semi-arid counties in the north and northeast having net enrollment rates below 30%.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nIn January 2003, the Kibaki government abolished all tuition fees for public primary schools. The government introduced a per-pupil capitation grant of KES 1,020 (approximately $13.50) to replace lost fee revenue, channeled directly to schools through newly established school bank accounts. The grants were intended to cover instructional materials, minor maintenance, and activity costs.\n\nThe policy was announced publicly before schools opened in January 2003, and the enrollment response was immediate and overwhelming. Schools in many areas were inundated with students, including over-age children and adults who had never attended school. Classrooms designed for 40 students suddenly had 70 or more. The Ministry of Education scrambled to recruit additional teachers and procure textbooks.\n\nTo address the teacher shortage, Kenya hired tens of thousands of contract teachers through the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and later through school management committees under the School-Based Teacher Management (SBTM) policy. These contract teachers were typically paid significantly less than civil service teachers and lacked job security, a design feature studied extensively by researchers.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe access gains were substantial and well-documented. Gross enrollment in primary school rose from 6.1 million in 2002 to 7.6 million in 2003, with the net enrollment rate increasing from approximately 62% to over 80% in a single year. By 2009, the net enrollment rate reached 92.9% according to Ministry of Education statistics. Gender parity improved significantly, with the Gender Parity Index reaching 0.98 by 2009, indicating near-equal enrollment of boys and girls.\n\nHowever, evidence on learning quality was far less encouraging. Bold et al. (2013), in a study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, conducted a randomized controlled trial examining contract teachers in Kenya. They found that contract teachers hired locally by school committees were significantly more effective at raising test scores than centrally-hired civil service teachers, partly because local hiring created accountability to communities. Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2015), published in the *American Economic Review*, evaluated a program combining class size reduction with contract teachers in western Kenya. They found that adding a contract teacher and reducing class sizes significantly improved test scores, with effects persisting years later.\n\nUwezo, a citizen-led assessment initiative, documented the learning crisis starkly. Their 2011 assessment found that only about 30% of children in Class 3 could read a Class 2-level story in English, suggesting that enrollment gains had not translated proportionally into learning gains. The World Bank's Service Delivery Indicators survey found high teacher absenteeism rates averaging 47% across sampled schools.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe primary criticism of Kenya's FPE policy has been the quantity-quality tradeoff. Pupil-teacher ratios rose sharply, particularly in high-poverty areas, with some schools reporting ratios above 100:1 in the immediate post-reform period. Infrastructure was inadequate: many schools lacked sufficient classrooms, desks, latrines, and textbooks. The capitation grants, while important, were frequently delayed and insufficient to cover actual costs, leading many schools to continue charging informal fees despite the policy.\n\nCorruption in resource allocation was documented repeatedly. A 2010 audit by the Kenya National Audit Office found significant mismanagement of FPE funds at both central and school levels. Additionally, the focus on primary education contributed to a bottleneck at the secondary level, where fees remained a barrier, leading to high dropout rates after primary completion. Critics, including Oketch and Rolleston (2007), argued that the policy addressed enrollment without a coherent strategy for learning quality improvement.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Fee abolition works for access but is not sufficient for learning**: Removing financial barriers dramatically increases enrollment, but without corresponding investments in quality inputs—teachers, materials, infrastructure—learning outcomes may stagnate or decline.\n- **Contract teacher models show promise but need careful design**: Evidence from Bold et al. (2013) and Duflo et al. (2015) suggests that locally-hired, locally-accountable contract teachers can improve learning outcomes, but they require fair pay structures to be sustainable.\n- **Supply-side readiness must precede or accompany demand-side reforms**: Governments should prepare for enrollment surges by pre-positioning teachers, materials, and infrastructure before announcing fee abolition.\n- **Direct school funding requires accountability mechanisms**: Capitation grants sent directly to schools can be effective but require strong financial oversight at the school level and timely disbursement from central government.\n- **Access reforms must be linked to quality measurement**: Citizen-led assessments like Uwezo and systematic learning measurement are essential complements to enrollment-focused policies.\n\n## References\n\n- Bold, T., Kimenyi, M., Mwabu, G., Ng'ang'a, A., and Sandefur, J.
