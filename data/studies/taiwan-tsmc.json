  "content": "## Background\n\nTaiwan's emergence as the world's semiconductor capital represents one of the most consequential examples of industrial policy in the late twentieth century. In the early 1970s, Taiwan was a low-cost manufacturing economy producing textiles, processed food, and simple electronics. The government recognized that rising wages would erode competitiveness in labor-intensive sectors and that moving into technology-intensive industries was essential for sustained development.\n\nThe institutional foundation was the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), established in 1973 under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. ITRI's mandate was to acquire foreign technologies, adapt them for commercial application, and transfer them to Taiwan's private sector. In 1974, ITRI's Electronics Research and Service Organization (ERSO) negotiated a landmark technology transfer agreement with RCA, the American electronics company, to bring integrated circuit fabrication technology to Taiwan.\n\nThe RCA agreement sent over 40 Taiwanese engineers to RCA's facilities in New Jersey for hands-on training in semiconductor manufacturing. Upon their return, they established a pilot IC fabrication line at ITRI, which by the late 1970s was producing commercial-grade chips. This government-funded technology acquisition and human capital development laid the essential groundwork for what would become the world's most important semiconductor cluster.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe pivotal intervention was the recruitment of Morris Chang, a senior Texas Instruments executive born in mainland China and educated at MIT and Stanford, to lead ITRI in 1985. Chang brought deep industry knowledge and a transformative business concept: the pure-play foundry model. Rather than designing and manufacturing its own branded chips (the integrated model of Intel, Samsung, and others), TSMC would manufacture chips designed by other companies, serving as a neutral contract manufacturer.\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 with the government as majority shareholder (through the National Development Fund, which invested $100 million) and Philips Semiconductors as a minority technology partner providing advanced process technology and credibility with international customers. Fuller (2005) documented how this hybrid model, combining state capital, foreign technology partnerships, and private management, was critical to TSMC's success.\n\nThe Hsinchu Science Park, established in 1980 adjacent to National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University, provided the physical and institutional ecosystem. Modeled partly on Silicon Valley, the park offered tax incentives, subsidized facilities, streamlined regulations, and proximity to university research and talent pipelines. TSMC was located in Hsinchu, and the park subsequently attracted hundreds of semiconductor design firms, equipment suppliers, and related technology companies.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nTSMC's trajectory redefined the global semiconductor industry. The pure-play foundry model enabled the emergence of fabless semiconductor design companies (including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, Apple's chip design division, and MediaTek), which could innovate in chip design without the enormous capital requirements of building their own fabrication plants. This innovation in industrial organization arguably catalyzed more innovation than any single technical advance.\n\nBy 2023, TSMC commanded approximately 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market. The company's revenue reached $69.3 billion (NT$2.16 trillion), and it manufactured the world's most advanced chips at the 3-nanometer process node. TSMC's technological leadership in advanced manufacturing became a matter of global strategic significance, with the United States, European Union, and Japan all seeking to attract TSMC fabrication facilities to reduce dependence on Taiwan-based production.\n\nTaiwan's broader semiconductor ecosystem grew in parallel. By the 2020s, Taiwan's semiconductor industry employed over 300,000 workers and generated export revenues of approximately $180 billion annually. Taiwan accounted for over 90% of global production of the most advanced chips (below 10 nanometers), creating what analysts termed a \"silicon shield\" of strategic importance.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe concentration of advanced semiconductor manufacturing in Taiwan creates significant geopolitical risk. Cross-strait tensions with China mean that a substantial share of the world's most critical technology supply chain is located in a potential conflict zone. This concentration risk has prompted the US CHIPS Act and similar European and Japanese initiatives to diversify semiconductor production geographically.\n\nTSMC's dominance also raises questions about industrial sustainability. The enormous capital requirements of leading-edge fabrication (a single advanced fab costs over $20 billion) create barriers to entry that may reduce long-term competitive dynamics. Taiwan faces growing water scarcity challenges that threaten the water-intensive semiconductor manufacturing process, as the severe drought of 2021 demonstrated. Talent shortages, as the industry competes for a finite pool of advanced engineering graduates, also constrain growth.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Government-funded technology transfer and human capital development can establish the knowledge base necessary for a country to enter frontier technology industries.\n- Business model innovation (the pure-play foundry concept) can be as important as technological innovation in creating globally dominant firms.\n- Science parks that combine proximity to universities, government research institutes, and industry can create self-reinforcing clusters of innovation.\n- The recruitment of diaspora talent with international industry experience can provide critical knowledge and networks that domestic institutions alone cannot generate.\n- Industrial policy success in technology sectors creates new dependencies and geopolitical vulnerabilities that require ongoing strategic management.\n\n## References\n\n- Fuller, D.
