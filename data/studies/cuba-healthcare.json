  "content": "## Background\n\nFollowing the 1959 revolution, Cuba lost approximately half of its 6,000 physicians to emigration, primarily to the United States. This crisis forced the revolutionary government to fundamentally restructure the healthcare system. Under Fidel Castro's leadership, healthcare was declared a basic right and became a central priority of state investment, with the goal of creating a universal, free, and preventive healthcare model.\n\nThe government massively expanded medical education, increasing medical school enrollment and establishing new training institutions across the country. By the 1980s, Cuba had reversed its physician shortage and begun producing doctors far in excess of domestic needs. This surplus of medical professionals became the foundation of Cuba's medical internationalism—a strategy that served both humanitarian and geopolitical purposes.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nCuba's healthcare model rests on a three-tiered system centered on primary care. At the base are the consultorios (family doctor-and-nurse offices), established in the 1980s, where physician-nurse teams serve defined geographic populations of approximately 120–150 families. Above these are polyclinics providing specialized outpatient services, and at the apex are hospitals for tertiary care.\n\nThe emphasis on prevention and primary care has produced remarkable results. Universal vaccination programs, prenatal care, community health surveillance, and health education campaigns have driven communicable disease rates to levels comparable with or better than developed nations. In 2015, Cuba became the first country certified by the WHO as having eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.\n\nCuba's medical internationalism began in 1963 with a mission to Algeria and expanded dramatically over subsequent decades. The government deployed health professionals through bilateral agreements, multilateral programs, and emergency responses. The Henry Reeve International Medical Brigade, established in 2005, specializes in disaster response and epidemic control.\n\nThe most prominent international program was Mais Médicos in Brazil, launched in 2013, which deployed approximately 8,000 Cuban doctors to underserved areas of Brazil. At its peak, Cuba earned an estimated US$6–11 billion annually from medical services exports—more than any other export sector including tourism and nickel.\n\nIn 1999, Cuba established the Latin American School of Medicine (ELAM) in Havana, offering free medical training to students from developing countries. By 2020, ELAM had graduated over 30,000 physicians from more than 100 countries.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nCooper, Kennelly, and Ordúñez-García (2006), writing in *The Lancet*, provided a comprehensive analysis of Cuba's healthcare achievements. They documented infant mortality of 5.3 per 1,000 (which has since fallen to 4.4), life expectancy of 77.5 years (now 78.8), and universal healthcare coverage—outcomes achieved with health expenditure of approximately US$300 per capita, a fraction of spending in developed countries.\n\nThe authors attributed Cuba's success to the emphasis on primary care and prevention, high physician density, community-based health surveillance, and the integration of social determinants of health into medical practice. They noted that Cuba's experience demonstrated that good health outcomes were achievable independent of high GDP.\n\nFeinsilver (2010) analyzed the political economy of Cuba's medical diplomacy, arguing that it served multiple functions: generating foreign exchange, building diplomatic alliances, enhancing Cuba's international prestige, and reinforcing the domestic legitimacy of the revolutionary government. She estimated that medical services had become Cuba's largest source of hard currency, surpassing tourism.\n\nDe Vos et al. (2016) examined the effectiveness of Cuban medical missions in 67 countries, finding evidence of improved health outcomes in communities served by Cuban doctors, particularly in maternal and child health and management of chronic diseases.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCuba's healthcare system faces significant challenges. The economic crisis following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 led to severe shortages of medicines, medical equipment, and supplies—conditions that have persisted due to the US embargo and economic mismanagement. Hospital infrastructure has deteriorated significantly.\n\nCritics have questioned the working conditions of Cuban doctors deployed abroad, with some describing the arrangements as exploitative. Doctors reportedly receive only a fraction of the fees paid by host governments to the Cuban state. Desertions have been common, with an estimated 7,000–8,000 Cuban medical professionals leaving their missions since the 1990s.\n\nThe two-tier system that emerged between facilities serving international medical tourists (generating hard currency) and those serving the Cuban population has been a source of domestic discontent. Access to medicines remains problematic, with frequent shortages of basic drugs.\n\nSome scholars have questioned the reliability of Cuba's official health statistics, noting the incentive structures and political pressures that may influence data reporting.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Universal primary healthcare systems can achieve remarkable health outcomes at low cost when prevention and community-based care are prioritized\n- Investment in medical education at scale can create exportable human capital and diplomatic leverage\n- Health diplomacy can serve simultaneous humanitarian, economic, and geopolitical objectives\n- System sustainability requires economic foundations beyond political will—Cuba's model has been strained by broader economic failures\n- The labor conditions of health workers in export models require scrutiny to ensure ethical standards\n\n## References\n\n1.
