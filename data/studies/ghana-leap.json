  "content": "## Background\n\nGhana had achieved significant poverty reduction since the early 1990s, with the national poverty rate falling from 51.7% in 1991/92 to 24.2% in 2012/13 according to the Ghana Living Standards Surveys. However, extreme poverty remained entrenched in specific geographic areas—particularly the three northern regions (Northern, Upper East, and Upper West)—and among specific demographic groups including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and households caring for orphans. The northern regions had poverty rates exceeding 50%, compared to under 10% in Greater Accra, reflecting deep-rooted spatial inequality.\n\nPrior to LEAP, Ghana's social protection system was fragmented and limited. The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) provided formal sector pensions, but only approximately 10% of the workforce was covered. The National Health Insurance Scheme provided some risk protection but, as discussed elsewhere, had limited effective coverage among the poorest. Community and family-based support systems were weakening due to urbanization, migration, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\nThe concept of a targeted cash transfer programme for the extreme poor gained traction in the mid-2000s, influenced by the demonstrated success of conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America (particularly Mexico's Oportunidades/Progresa and Brazil's Bolsa Familia) and growing evidence that direct cash transfers could reduce poverty and improve human capital outcomes. DFID and the World Bank provided technical and financial support for programme design.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nLEAP was launched in March 2008, initially reaching 1,654 households in 21 districts across all 10 regions. The programme targeted four categories of the extreme poor: the elderly (65 years and above) without productive capacity; persons with severe disabilities; households caring for orphans and vulnerable children; and, from 2015, pregnant women in extreme poverty. Eligibility was determined through a two-stage process: community-based selection committees identified potential beneficiaries through participatory wealth ranking, and then a proxy means test was applied to verify eligibility.\n\nTransfer amounts were set by household size: single-member households received GHS 64 per month, while households with four or more eligible members received GHS 106 per month (approximately $8-15, though rates were periodically adjusted). Payments were made bimonthly through e-zwich biometric smart cards or mobile money. While LEAP was technically described as a conditional cash transfer, the conditions—enrolling children in school and registering births—were not systematically monitored or enforced, making it a de facto unconditional transfer.\n\nA distinctive feature was the linkage to the National Health Insurance Scheme: LEAP beneficiaries were automatically enrolled in the NHIS with their premiums paid by the government. This cross-programme integration was designed to address the interconnected nature of poverty, ensuring that extremely poor households had both income support and health coverage. The programme was managed by the Department of Social Welfare under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, with technical support from UNICEF, DFID, and the World Bank.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe most rigorous evidence on LEAP's impact comes from a mixed-methods evaluation conducted by the Oxford Policy Management (OPM) group and the University of North Carolina (UNC). The OPM (2013) quantitative evaluation, using a regression discontinuity design, found that LEAP had statistically significant positive effects on school enrollment for children in beneficiary households, food security (measured by dietary diversity and number of meals), and health care utilization through the NHIS linkage. The evaluation also found reductions in child labor, particularly in economic activities.\n\nHanda et al. (2014), in a study conducted under the Transfer Project research consortium, analyzed LEAP's broader social and economic impacts. They found that LEAP transfers had positive effects on household consumption, with spending increases concentrated on food and education. The study also documented positive effects on social inclusion, with beneficiaries reporting feeling less marginalized and more able to participate in community activities. Importantly, the study found no evidence of the commonly feared adverse behavioral effects—dependency, reduced work effort, or increased fertility.\n\nThe programme also contributed to household financial inclusion. A 2016 evaluation found that the shift to electronic payments through e-zwich and mobile money increased beneficiaries' engagement with formal financial services, though challenges with biometric identification systems (particularly for elderly beneficiaries with worn fingerprints) created access barriers.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nTransfer adequacy was the most common criticism. At GHS 64-106 per month ($8-15), the transfers represented a fraction of the poverty line and were considered too small to enable meaningful accumulation or sustainable poverty exit. The bimonthly payment schedule created cash flow challenges, and delays in payments—sometimes extending to several months—undermined the programme's reliability. The value of transfers eroded significantly in real terms between periodic adjustments, particularly during episodes of high inflation.\n\nTargeting accuracy was mixed. The community-based selection process, while participatory, was susceptible to local power dynamics, with studies documenting that community leaders sometimes directed benefits toward their own networks. The proxy means test, intended as a verification tool, used indicators that were sometimes poorly suited to the local context. A 2013 evaluation estimated significant exclusion errors, with many of the extreme poor not captured by the programme. Coverage remained limited: even at 350,000 households, LEAP reached only an estimated 25-30% of extremely poor households, and geographic coverage was uneven despite the programme's expansion.\n\nGraduation and sustainability were also concerns. LEAP lacked a systematic graduation strategy—there was no clear mechanism for households to exit the programme when their circumstances improved, nor complementary livelihood programmes to build productive capacity. The programme relied significantly on donor financing (DFID/FCDO and World Bank were major funders), raising questions about fiscal sustainability as Ghana's debt levels increased and donor priorities shifted.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Cash transfers can improve welfare among the extreme poor in Africa**: LEAP demonstrated that direct cash transfers, even at modest levels, produce measurable improvements in food security, education, and health utilization among the poorest households.\n- **Cross-programme linkages add value**: The automatic NHIS enrollment for LEAP beneficiaries exemplified how connecting social protection programmes with health insurance can address multiple dimensions of poverty simultaneously.\n- **Community-based targeting has strengths but requires safeguards**: Participatory wealth ranking leverages local knowledge but needs transparent grievance mechanisms and independent verification to prevent elite capture.\n- **Electronic payment systems improve efficiency but create new exclusions**: Biometric payment systems reduced leakage but created barriers for elderly and disabled beneficiaries with identification challenges.\n- **Transfer values must be regularly adjusted to maintain impact**: Without automatic indexation to inflation, the real value of transfers deteriorates over time, gradually undermining programme impact.\n\n## References\n\n- Handa, S., Park, M., Osei-Darko, R., Osei-Akoto, I., Davis, B., and Daidone, S.
