  "content": "## Background\n\nCotton has been central to Uzbekistan's economy and identity since the Soviet era, when the Uzbek SSR was the USSR's primary cotton producer. The Soviet-era system of forced mobilization for the annual harvest — including school children, university students, medical workers, and civil servants — persisted largely unchanged after independence in 1991 under President Islam Karimov. The state maintained a monopoly on cotton purchasing, set production quotas for farmers, and organized mass mobilization each autumn.\n\nKandiyoti (2008) documented how the cotton monoculture system perpetuated rural poverty, environmental degradation (including the Aral Sea disaster), and authoritarian control. Cotton revenues flowed to the state, while farmers received below-market prices. By the mid-2000s, international human rights organizations, including the Environmental Justice Foundation and Human Rights Watch, began documenting the systematic use of child labor, estimating that up to 18% of harvesters were children.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nInternational pressure came through multiple channels. The Cotton Campaign, a coalition of human rights, labor, and business organizations, launched a global boycott pledge in 2009, eventually securing commitments from over 330 brands and retailers — including major companies like H&M, Adidas, and Gap — to avoid Uzbek cotton. This threatened Uzbekistan's access to global textile supply chains.\n\nThe ILO began systematic monitoring of the cotton harvest in 2013, initially with limited access but gradually expanding its observation. The ILO's Third-Party Monitoring (TPM) program deployed observers across cotton-growing regions during each harvest season, conducting thousands of interviews with workers and community members.\n\nThe most significant shift came after President Shavkat Mirziyoyev succeeded Karimov in 2016 and initiated broader economic reforms. Specific cotton sector measures included: explicit government decrees prohibiting child and forced labor, prosecution of local officials who organized forced mobilization, establishment of feedback mechanisms (hotlines and apps) for reporting coercion, gradual privatization of cotton-textile clusters, and increases in prices paid to farmers.\n\nThe World Bank, which had conditioned its agricultural loans on labor reforms, played a key role in supporting the monitoring framework and incentivizing compliance.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe ILO's 2021 TPM report found that systematic child labor had been eliminated, reaching \"statistically zero\" — a dramatic decline from the estimated 18% in the mid-2000s. Systematic forced labor of adults also declined significantly, from an estimated 14% of workers in 2015 to 4% in 2021, though isolated cases persisted.\n\nIn March 2022, the Cotton Campaign formally declared that Uzbekistan had ended the system of government-imposed forced labor in the cotton sector and lifted its call for a global boycott. This was a landmark moment, representing one of the most successful international advocacy campaigns against forced labor in a specific commodity chain.\n\nReforms also began to address the underlying economic structure. Cotton-textile clusters were established to increase domestic value-added processing, with the goal of exporting finished textiles rather than raw cotton. Farmer prices were gradually increased, and the state purchasing monopoly was relaxed. Between 2017 and 2022, textile exports grew substantially as vertical integration progressed.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite the elimination of systematic forced labor, the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights and other monitors continued to document cases of coercion at the local level, particularly involving public sector workers. The transition from a command system to voluntary recruitment created labor shortages in some regions, leading to higher wages but also occasional recurrence of informal pressure.\n\nThe broader cotton sector reform remained incomplete. Many farmers still operated under effective state quotas, land reform was slow, and the privatization of cotton-textile clusters faced allegations of insider deals benefiting politically connected individuals. Water management for cotton irrigation continued to strain already depleted resources.\n\nCritics also questioned whether the reforms would survive a change in political leadership or economic downturn, given that they were driven primarily by presidential decree rather than institutionalized through independent labor inspection and judicial enforcement.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- International supply chain pressure through brand boycotts can be a powerful lever for labor reform, particularly when coordinated across industry sectors\n- Independent third-party monitoring (ILO's TPM model) provides credible verification that neither governments nor advocates alone can deliver\n- Eliminating forced labor requires both top-down political will and bottom-up feedback mechanisms for reporting coercion\n- Economic reforms (higher farmer prices, market liberalization) must accompany labor reforms to make voluntary harvesting economically viable\n- Sustained engagement over many years (2009 boycott to 2022 resolution) is typically required for systemic change in entrenched labor practices\n\n## References\n\n1.
