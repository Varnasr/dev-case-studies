  "content": "## Background\n\nThe Office du Niger is one of Africa's largest and oldest irrigation schemes, conceived during French colonial rule as a grandiose project to transform the semi-arid floodplain of the Niger River's inland delta into a major cotton-producing zone. The French colonial engineer Emile Belime championed the project beginning in the 1920s, and construction of the Markala diversion dam and primary canals began in 1932. Forced labor from across French West Africa was used to build the infrastructure, a legacy that casts a long shadow over the scheme's history.\n\nThe original ambition was to irrigate 960,000 hectares for cotton production to supply French textile mills, reducing metropolitan dependence on American cotton. In practice, the scheme massively underperformed these targets. By independence in 1960, only about 50,000 hectares were developed, and cotton yields were poor. Under post-independence state management, the scheme stagnated, with deteriorating infrastructure, low yields, and a heavy bureaucratic apparatus that extracted resources from tenant farmers through compulsory cotton delivery quotas.\n\nMajor reforms began in the 1990s under structural adjustment and donor pressure. The World Bank and other donors funded rehabilitation of canals and drainage systems, rice replaced cotton as the primary crop, and management was partially decentralized. Aw and Diemer (2005) provided a comprehensive account of the scheme's evolution from colonial failure to a more productive but still troubled irrigation system, documenting how institutional reforms improved rice yields from roughly 1.5 tonnes per hectare in the 1980s to 4-6 tonnes per hectare in rehabilitated areas.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Office du Niger operates as a parastatal organization managing water allocation, infrastructure maintenance, and tenant farmer relations across the scheme. Following the 1990s reforms, the system shifted from a command economy model to one in which farmers had greater autonomy over crop choice and marketing, though the Office retained control over land allocation and water management. Farmers pay an annual water fee (redevance) of approximately 67,000 CFA francs per hectare to finance canal maintenance and water delivery.\n\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, the Malian government pursued large-scale foreign investment to expand the irrigated area. The most controversial agreement was the 2008 deal with Libya's Malibya initiative, which allocated 100,000 hectares of land in the Office du Niger zone for mechanized rice and livestock production, effectively doubling the scheme's planned area. Similar agreements were signed with investors from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries, part of the global wave of large-scale land acquisitions that followed the 2007-2008 food price crisis.\n\nResearch by Belieres, Hilhorst, and colleagues at CIRAD and the Royal Tropical Institute examined the impacts of these reforms and investments on smallholder farmers. Their work highlighted the tension between the government's ambition to attract large-scale investment for agricultural modernization and the rights and livelihoods of existing tenant farmers and pastoral communities who depended on the same land and water resources.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe post-reform Office du Niger has become Mali's primary rice production zone, producing approximately 600,000 tonnes annually and contributing significantly to national food security. Rice yields in well-maintained areas reach 4-6 tonnes per hectare under double cropping, a dramatic improvement from the colonial and immediate post-colonial periods. Aw and Diemer (2005) attributed these gains to improved water management, farmer autonomy in crop choice, better varieties including NERICA rice, and the expansion of market incentives.\n\nHowever, the large-scale land allocation deals generated intense controversy. Belieres et al. (2011) documented how the Malibya project displaced smallholder farmers without adequate compensation and diverted water resources from existing canal systems. The Oakland Institute (2011) published a critical report detailing how several large land deals in the Office du Niger zone threatened the livelihoods of thousands of farming families. The Malibya project was suspended following the 2011 fall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya and the 2012 political crisis in Mali, but the land allocations were never formally reversed.\n\nWater management remains a critical constraint. The scheme draws water from the Niger River through the Markala Dam, but upstream development in Guinea and climate variability threaten future water availability. During low-flow years, tail-end farmers receive insufficient water, creating significant yield disparities within the scheme. Studies by Vandersypen et al. (2006) showed that water distribution inequities disproportionately affected poorer farmers located at the periphery of the canal system.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Office du Niger embodies the tensions inherent in large-scale irrigation development in Africa. Governance of the scheme remains contested, with farmer organizations demanding greater voice in decision-making, while the government and Office du Niger management prioritize investment attraction and revenue generation. Land tenure insecurity is a persistent concern, as farmers hold use rights (permis d'exploitation) that can be revoked, creating vulnerability to dispossession for large-scale investments.\n\nInfrastructure deterioration in unrehabilitated areas, combined with inadequate maintenance budgets, means that large portions of the scheme operate well below potential. The annual water fee, while necessary for maintenance, represents a significant burden for poorer farmers. Environmental concerns include soil salinization in some areas and the scheme's impact on downstream wetland ecosystems in the Inner Niger Delta, a Ramsar-designated wetland of international importance.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Colonial-era irrigation mega-projects often massively underperformed their ambitious targets, but can be reformed and improved over time with appropriate institutional changes and investment.\n- Shifting from state-controlled to farmer-oriented management of irrigation schemes can dramatically improve productivity, as the transition from cotton to rice in the Office du Niger demonstrates.\n- Large-scale land acquisitions for agricultural investment can conflict with existing smallholder and pastoral livelihoods, requiring careful governance of land and water rights.\n- Water management equity within large irrigation schemes is critical; tail-end farmers consistently receive less water and lower yields, requiring institutional mechanisms to address distributional fairness.\n- Sustainable irrigation development must account for upstream-downstream water allocation and environmental impacts on dependent ecosystems.\n\n## References\n\n- Aw, D., & Diemer, G.
