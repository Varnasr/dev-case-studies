  "content": "## Background\n\nSoil-transmitted helminths (intestinal worms) infect over 1.5 billion people worldwide, predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation. The three main species, roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), and hookworm (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale), cause iron deficiency anemia, malnutrition, impaired cognitive development, and reduced physical capacity. School-age children bear a disproportionate burden, with prevalence rates exceeding 50% in many endemic areas.\n\nDeworming treatment is remarkably inexpensive: a single dose of albendazole costs approximately $0.02–$0.03 and can be safely administered by teachers without medical supervision. Mass drug administration (MDA) through schools was proposed as a cost-effective strategy for reducing worm burden and improving child health and educational outcomes. However, the health and educational benefits of mass deworming in the absence of improved sanitation were debated.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nMiguel and Kremer's study, published in *Econometrica* in 2004, evaluated a school-based deworming program in Busia district, western Kenya, implemented by the NGO Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) beginning in 1998. The study used a randomized phased rollout across 75 schools, with schools receiving the program in three waves. Treatment included albendazole for soil-transmitted helminths and praziquantel for schistosomiasis, administered twice yearly.\n\nThe study's most influential finding was that deworming reduced school absenteeism by approximately 25% (7 percentage points). Crucially, the study also identified significant externality effects: children in untreated schools near treated schools also experienced reduced worm infections and improved attendance, because mass treatment reduced environmental contamination and disease transmission. This spillover effect meant that the total benefit of deworming was substantially larger than the direct effect on treated children alone.\n\nThe study's findings, combined with the extremely low cost of treatment, made deworming appear to be one of the most cost-effective development interventions available. GiveWell, the charity evaluator, recommended deworming organizations (Deworm the World, SCI Foundation) as among the most effective charities. The WHO set targets for 75% coverage of school-age children in endemic areas, and by 2023, over 600 million children were being treated annually through mass deworming campaigns.\n\nBaird, Hicks, Kremer, and Miguel (2016), in a 10-year follow-up study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* under the title \"Worms at Work,\" found that individuals who had been dewormed as children earned 29% more and worked 12% more hours than those in control groups. These long-term economic benefits provided a powerful argument for early-childhood health investments.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe evidence debate around deworming became one of the most significant methodological controversies in development economics. Taylor-Robinson et al. (2015), in an updated Cochrane systematic review, concluded that mass deworming programs had little or no detectable effect on hemoglobin levels, cognition, school attendance, or school performance when analyzed across all available trials. The review included 45 trials and found that while deworming reliably reduced worm infection, the evidence for downstream health and educational benefits was weak.\n\nAiken et al. (2015) conducted a detailed replication of Miguel and Kremer's original analysis and found that some key results were sensitive to analytical choices. Their replication produced smaller and statistically insignificant effects on school attendance, though they noted that their analysis differed from the original in several methodological ways. Miguel and Kremer (2015) responded by defending their original analysis while accepting that the evidence had become more nuanced than early discussions suggested.\n\nThe resulting \"worm wars\" debate engaged dozens of researchers and generated extensive commentary. Humphrey (2009) argued that even if deworming produced modest health gains, its extremely low cost meant it could still be cost-effective relative to alternatives. The Disease Control Priorities (DCP3) project, a comprehensive assessment of health intervention cost-effectiveness, continued to include school-based deworming as a recommended intervention.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe controversy revealed deeper tensions in evidence-based development. The Cochrane review methodology, which prioritized internal validity and focused narrowly on individual-level randomized evidence, reached different conclusions than analyses that incorporated externality effects and long-term follow-up data. Supporters of deworming argued that the Cochrane framework was poorly suited to evaluating public health interventions with significant spillover effects.\n\nEpidemiological context matters enormously. The benefits of mass deworming depend on baseline worm prevalence, species composition, infection intensity, and reinfection rates. In areas with low prevalence or primarily light infections, the expected health benefits are minimal. This heterogeneity makes blanket recommendations problematic and supports targeted rather than universal programs.\n\nThe emphasis on deworming has been criticized as diverting attention from the fundamental solution: improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure that prevents reinfection. Mass drug administration without environmental improvements requires indefinite repetition, as children are rapidly reinfected.\n\nThe debate also highlighted the risks of relying heavily on single influential studies to guide policy. The original Miguel and Kremer findings were widely cited as established fact for a decade before serious scrutiny of the statistical methods was undertaken.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Single influential studies, however well-designed, should not be treated as definitive; replication and systematic review are essential\n- Cost-effectiveness depends not just on effect sizes but also on program costs, making even small effects potentially worthwhile for very cheap interventions\n- Spillover and externality effects can be critical for evaluating public health interventions but are difficult to capture in standard trial designs\n- Long-term follow-up studies provide qualitatively different evidence than short-term evaluations and can substantially change cost-effectiveness calculations\n- Context specificity (worm prevalence, species, intensity) should guide implementation decisions rather than blanket global recommendations\n\n## References\n\n1.
