Over 15 years, BISP has grown into one of the largest social safety nets in the developing world, reaching over 9 million families — predominantly through payments made directly to women. Despite political turbulence that saw power change hands between the PPP, PML-N, and PTI governments, BISP survived and expanded, a rare example of institutional continuity in Pakistan's fractured political landscape. World Bank evaluations found measurable impacts on consumption, food security, and women's decision-making power. However, graduation out of poverty remained elusive for most beneficiaries, and the programme's per-household transfer remained too small to be transformative. Verdict: BISP proved that even fragile states can build durable social protection — but cash alone does not defeat poverty.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nPakistan in 2008 was a country under siege — from multiple directions simultaneously. The global food and fuel price crisis had pushed an estimated 10 million additional Pakistanis below the poverty line in a single year. Inflation surged past 25%, with wheat flour prices nearly doubling between 2007 and 2008. The country was fighting a bloody insurgency in its tribal areas, hosting over 3 million internally displaced persons, and navigating a fraught democratic transition after nine years of military rule under General Pervez Musharraf.\n\nThe newly elected Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government, led by President Asif Ali Zardari following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, faced a legitimacy crisis. It needed to deliver something tangible to the poor — fast. Pakistan's existing social protection infrastructure was negligible. The country spent less than 0.3% of GDP on social safety nets, compared to 1.5% in India and 2.3% in Brazil. Zakat, the Islamic charitable obligation administered by the state since 1980, reached fewer than 1 million households and was plagued by political patronage and leakage.\n\nPoverty in Pakistan was — and remains — staggering in scale. In 2008, roughly 60 million Pakistanis lived below the national poverty line. Multidimensional poverty was even more widespread: nearly 40% of the population lacked access to basic sanitation, 22% of children were out of school, and maternal mortality stood at 276 per 100,000 live births. The country ranked 136th out of 182 nations on the Human Development Index.\n\nCritically, Pakistan had no reliable database of who its poor citizens actually were. Previous welfare programmes had relied on lists compiled by local politicians — a system that virtually guaranteed patronage, exclusion of the truly destitute, and inclusion of the politically connected. Any new programme would need, first and foremost, a way to identify and reach the poor that was insulated from political manipulation.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nBISP was established through an Act of Parliament in July 2008 with an initial budget of PKR 34 billion (approximately USD 425 million). The programme had three foundational design choices that would define its trajectory:\n\n**1. Proxy Means Testing (PMT) via the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER)**\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, BISP conducted a door-to-door poverty census covering approximately 27 million households across Pakistan — one of the largest data collection exercises in the country's history. Enumerators collected information on 23 variables: housing quality, asset ownership, education levels, landholding, livestock, and demographic characteristics. These were fed into a proxy means test formula that generated a poverty score from 0 to 100 for each household. Families scoring below a cutoff (initially 16.17) were deemed eligible.\n\nThis was a deliberate rejection of the previous system where parliamentarians each nominated beneficiaries from their constituencies. The scorecard was designed by the World Bank and deployed by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), leveraging Pakistan's existing national ID card (CNIC) infrastructure.\n\n**2. Payments to Women**\n\nIn a deeply patriarchal society where only 25% of women had a CNIC in 2008, BISP made a radical choice: payments would go exclusively to the female head of each eligible household. This required a massive drive to register millions of women for national identity cards — a precondition for receiving transfers. Between 2008 and 2012, BISP facilitated the issuance of over 4 million new CNICs to women who had previously been invisible to the state.\n\n**3. Unconditional Cash Transfers**\n\nUnlike Brazil's Bolsa Familia or Mexico's Progresa/Oportunidades, BISP's core transfer was unconditional — no requirements to send children to school or visit health clinics. This was a pragmatic choice: Pakistan lacked the administrative capacity to monitor conditionalities, and supply-side constraints (absent schools, dysfunctional clinics) meant that demanding service utilization could penalize the poorest.\n\nThe initial transfer was PKR 1,000 per month (approximately USD 12) per household, later raised to PKR 2,000, then PKR 5,000 quarterly, and eventually reaching PKR 8,750 quarterly (approximately USD 31) by 2023. Payment mechanisms evolved from money orders (slow, prone to leakage) to Benazir Debit Cards (introduced 2012) to biometric verification at ATMs and retail points.\n\n**Timeline of Key Milestones:**\n\n- **2008:** BISP established by PPP government; initial parliamentarian-nominated lists used\n- **2009-2011:** National poverty census conducted; PMT scorecard developed with World Bank support\n- **2012:** Transition to PMT-based targeting; Benazir Debit Cards introduced\n- **2013:** PML-N government retains BISP despite political rivalry with PPP\n- **2017:** Waseela-e-Taleem (education conditional transfer) added\n- **2019:** PTI government rebrands as Ehsaas; expands programme suite\n- **2020:** Emergency COVID-19 cash transfers to 16.9 million families via BISP/Ehsaas infrastructure\n- **2022:** Return of coalition government; programme continues as BISP\n- **2023:** NSER updated with door-to-door survey of 36 million households\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism: Theory of Change\n\nBISP's theory of change operated on multiple levels:\n\n**Immediate relief:** Cash transfers would smooth consumption for the ultra-poor, protecting food security and preventing distress coping strategies (pulling children from school, selling productive assets, taking on predatory debt).\n\n**Women's empowerment:** By channeling money through women, the programme aimed to increase female bargaining power within households, improve spending on children's nutrition and education, and bring millions of women into the formal identity system.\n\n**State-building:** The poverty registry would create a durable public good — a database that could be used for disaster response, health targeting, and other social programmes. BISP was, in effect, building the plumbing of a modern welfare state.\n\n**Graduation (later phase):** Through complementary programmes — skills training, interest-free loans, asset transfers — the poorest families would eventually \"graduate\" out of extreme poverty and no longer need cash transfers.\n\n**Political economy:** By creating a constituency of 9 million families directly receiving state benefits, BISP aimed to make social protection politically irreversible, regardless of which party held power.\n\n**Comparison with Regional Peers:**\n\nBISP's design borrowed from and diverged from the two most celebrated cash transfer programmes globally. Brazil's Bolsa Familia (launched 2003) used conditional transfers — requiring school attendance and health check-ups — and reached 14 million families, or roughly one-quarter of the population. India's PM-KISAN (launched 2019) chose a radically different approach: universal income support of INR 6,000 per year to all farmer families, regardless of poverty status, with no targeting mechanism at all. BISP sat between these two models: targeted like Bolsa Familia but unconditional like PM-KISAN. The targeting was more sophisticated than either — the PMT scorecard was internationally recognized as technically rigorous — but the transfer amount was far smaller relative to the poverty gap. Where Bolsa Familia lifted an estimated 20 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty, BISP's primary achievement was preventing further immiseration rather than enabling escape from poverty.\n\nThe choice to pay women was inspired by the growing body of evidence — from Progresa in Mexico, from randomized controlled trials in Kenya and Malawi — showing that cash in women's hands was more likely to be spent on food, children's health, and education than cash given to men. In Pakistan's deeply patriarchal context, where women's labour force participation was below 22% and women's mobility was severely restricted in large parts of Punjab and KPK, this was a bold bet. It paid off — but it also generated backlash. Reports from rural Sindh and southern Punjab documented cases of men confiscating women's BISP debit cards or accompanying them to ATMs and taking the cash. The programme's gender design was necessary but insufficient to overcome structural patriarchy.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBISP has been subject to unusually rigorous evaluation for a Pakistani government programme, including a World Bank-supported impact evaluation using a regression discontinuity design (comparing households just above and just below the PMT cutoff).\n\n**Consumption and Poverty:**\nThe World Bank's 2016 impact evaluation found that BISP increased monthly per capita consumption by approximately PKR 258 (about 10%) among beneficiary households. Food consumption rose by 9.4%. Beneficiary households were 7.5 percentage points less likely to fall below the food poverty line. However, the effect on overall poverty headcount was modest — the transfer was too small to lift most families above the poverty line.\n\n**Food Security:**\nBeneficiary households reported a significant reduction in the number of meals skipped per month. The incidence of households reporting \"not enough food\" declined by 12 percentage points. Dietary diversity improved, with increased consumption of protein (meat, eggs, dairy).\n\n**Women's Empowerment:**\nPerhaps BISP's most significant achievement has been in women's identity and agency. Over 8 million women received CNICs through BISP-facilitated drives. The evaluation found that BISP increased women's decision-making power over household purchases by 5-6 percentage points. Women beneficiaries reported greater mobility and reduced experience of controlling behaviour by male family members. Asset ownership in women's names increased modestly.\n\n**Education (Waseela-e-Taleem):**\nThe conditional education component, introduced in 2017, showed a 10.5 percentage point increase in primary school enrolment among beneficiary children in Punjab, with stronger effects for girls. However, the programme covered only a fraction of eligible families and faced monitoring challenges.\n\n**COVID-19 Response:**\nBISP's infrastructure proved its greatest value during the pandemic. In April 2020, the government disbursed emergency cash transfers of PKR 12,000 each to 16.9 million families within weeks — a logistical feat that would have been impossible without the NSER database and biometric payment systems. This was one of the fastest and largest COVID cash transfer programmes in the developing world.\n\n**Targeting Accuracy:**\nThe PMT system represented a dramatic improvement over parliamentarian-based selection. Independent analysis found that approximately 72% of BISP beneficiaries came from the poorest two quintiles, compared to less than 40% under the old system. Exclusion errors remained significant, however: an estimated 25-30% of eligible households were not covered, often because they lacked CNICs, lived in remote areas, or were missed during the census.\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**Transfer Size: Too Little to Transform**\n\nThe most fundamental criticism of BISP is that the transfer amount has always been too small to meaningfully change the trajectory of a family's life. At PKR 8,750 per quarter in 2023 (approximately USD 31), the transfer covered less than 15% of a poor household's monthly consumption needs. Adjusted for Pakistan's relentless inflation, the real value of the transfer has frequently declined. BISP was designed as a consumption floor, not a pathway out of poverty — and that is precisely what it delivered.\n\n**Graduation: The Missing Piece**\n\nBISP's graduation programmes — Waseela-e-Haq (asset transfer), Waseela-e-Rozgar (skills training) — have been chronically underfunded and poorly implemented. A 2019 review found that fewer than 2% of BISP beneficiaries had participated in any graduation programme. The asset transfer programme (providing PKR 300,000 in interest-free loans for small businesses) reached only 12,000 families out of a target population of millions. Without credible graduation pathways, BISP risks becoming permanent dependency without permanent poverty reduction.\n\n**Political Rebranding Without Substance**\n\nWhen the PTI government took power in 2018, Prime Minister Imran Khan rebranded BISP as the Ehsaas programme, adding multiple new sub-programmes (Ehsaas Kafaalat, Ehsaas Rations, Ehsaas Undergraduate Scholarship). While some additions were valuable, the rebranding created confusion, duplicated bureaucracies, and in some cases disrupted payment cycles for existing beneficiaries. Each government treated BISP as a political trophy rather than a technical institution.\n\n**Exclusion of the Hardest to Reach**\n\nDespite the PMT system's improvements, significant exclusion errors persist. Households in Balochistan's remote districts, religious minorities, transgender communities, and nomadic populations are systematically underrepresented. Women in the most conservative areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and tribal districts often cannot physically access payment points. The NSER census missed an estimated 7-10% of the poorest households.\n\n**Inflation Erosion**\n\nPakistan's macroeconomic instability has been BISP's silent enemy. With inflation exceeding 30% in 2023, the real purchasing power of BISP transfers collapsed. The programme's budget, while growing in nominal terms, has failed to keep pace with the cost of living. A transfer that bought 20 kg of wheat flour in 2008 bought roughly 10 kg in 2023.\n\n**Limited Health and Nutrition Impact**\n\nDespite increasing food consumption, BISP evaluations found no statistically significant impact on child stunting, wasting, or key maternal health indicators. Cash alone, without complementary nutrition education, deworming, or micronutrient supplementation, proved insufficient to address Pakistan's deep malnutrition crisis. Pakistan's child stunting rate of 40% — the highest among major South Asian economies — has barely budged since BISP's inception, suggesting that consumption-smoothing and nutritional transformation require fundamentally different interventions.\n\n**Fiscal Sustainability in a Crisis-Prone Economy**\n\nPakistan has been to the International Monetary Fund 23 times since independence — more than any other country. BISP's budget, while modest by international standards, is a significant fiscal commitment for a government that routinely struggles to meet basic expenditure obligations. During the 2022-23 balance-of-payments crisis, there were genuine concerns that BISP disbursements would be delayed or cut. The programme's dependence on World Bank co-financing (approximately USD 1.4 billion since 2009 through successive loans and credits) raises questions about long-term fiscal ownership. If Pakistan cannot fund its own social protection without external support, the programme remains vulnerable to donor fatigue and conditionality shifts.\n\n**The Comparison That Stings: What Bangladesh Did With Less**\n\nBangladesh, with similar per capita income and far smaller social protection budgets, achieved faster poverty reduction and dramatically better nutrition outcomes than Pakistan over the same period. Bangladesh's success rested not on a single flagship programme but on a dense ecosystem of NGO service delivery (BRAC), women's economic participation (garments sector), near-universal sanitation, and effective community health infrastructure. Pakistan's over-reliance on BISP as the primary anti-poverty instrument — without comparable investments in sanitation, women's education, or nutrition services — meant that cash transfers operated in a vacuum of missing complementary services.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. Invest in the Plumbing First**\nBISP's most enduring contribution is not the cash itself but the infrastructure: the national poverty registry, biometric identification, and digital payment rails. These proved invaluable during COVID-19 and natural disasters. Countries building social protection should prioritize systems over individual programmes.\n\n**2. Political-Proofing Matters**\nBISP survived three changes of government because it was established by law, backed by international financial institutions, and served a constituency too large to abandon. Designing programmes that create political incentives for continuation — rather than relying on the goodwill of future leaders — is essential in fragile democracies.\n\n**3. Cash Is Necessary but Not Sufficient**\nUnconditional cash transfers protect the poorest from the worst deprivations, but they do not — on their own — generate upward mobility. Graduation programmes, skills training, and complementary services (health, education, nutrition) must be funded at scale, not as token pilots.\n\n**4. Index Transfers to Inflation — Always**\nIn high-inflation environments, fixed nominal transfers lose value rapidly. Automatic indexation to consumer price indices should be built into programme design from the outset. Pakistan's failure to do this meant that BISP's real value eroded significantly over its first decade.\n\n**5. Women's Identity Is a Precondition for Women's Empowerment**\nBISP's requirement that women hold CNICs created a massive spillover benefit: millions of women became visible to the state for the first time. This has implications far beyond cash transfers — for voting rights, property ownership, and access to other services. Gender-focused delivery is not just an equity choice; it is a state-building strategy.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Year launched | 2008 |\n| Beneficiary households (2023) | 9.3 million |\n| Annual budget (FY 2023) | PKR 400 billion (~USD 1.4 billion) |\n| Budget as % of GDP | ~0.8% |\n| Quarterly transfer amount (2023) | PKR 8,750 (~USD 31) |\n| Households in NSER database | 36 million |\n| Women issued CNICs via BISP | 8+ million |\n| Consumption increase (evaluation) | ~10% per capita |\n| COVID-19 emergency disbursement | 16.9 million families |\n| Targeting accuracy (poorest 2 quintiles) | ~72% of beneficiaries |\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

Given Pakistan's low school enrolment rates and high malnutrition, was this the right choice? What are the administrative prerequisites for conditionality, and did Pakistan meet them in 2008?\n\n2. **Political Economy of Survival:** BISP is one of the very few Pakistani social programmes to survive multiple changes of government. What design features enabled this resilience? Could similar \"political-proofing\" strategies be applied to other sectors (health insurance, education reforms) in politically unstable states?\n\n3. **Cash vs. Capability:** The evidence shows BISP improved consumption but had no significant impact on child stunting or long-term human capital. Does this mean cash transfers are the wrong instrument for addressing Pakistan's malnutrition crisis, or does it mean the transfer was simply too small and too isolated from complementary services?"
