  "content": "## Background\n\nMyanmar's economic isolation began in earnest after the military's brutal suppression of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising and deepened following the annulment of the 1990 election results that would have brought Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) to power. The United States, European Union, and other Western nations imposed comprehensive sanctions including investment bans, import restrictions, asset freezes, and visa restrictions on military leaders. Combined with the military junta's autarkic economic policies, these sanctions left Myanmar one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia, with per capita GDP of approximately $1,100 in 2010.\n\nThe country's economic potential was significant, however. Myanmar possessed abundant natural resources including natural gas, gems, timber, and agricultural land; a strategic location between China, India, and Southeast Asia; and a young, relatively educated population of over 50 million. The formal economy was small and distorted, with military conglomerates and crony businesses dominating key sectors while a vast informal economy operated alongside.\n\nThe transition began in 2010–2011 when the military junta dissolved itself and transferred power to a nominally civilian government led by President Thein Sein, a retired general. Turnell (2011) analyzed the early financial reforms, noting that the new government moved rapidly on currency unification (ending the parallel exchange rate system), banking reform, and foreign investment liberalization, signaling genuine intent to modernize the economy.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe reform program was broad and rapid by the standards of transitioning economies. Key economic measures included the adoption of a managed float exchange rate (April 2012), replacing a dysfunctional fixed rate that had created a 100:1 gap between official and parallel rates; the Foreign Investment Law (2012), which opened most sectors to foreign investors; and telecommunications liberalization, which broke the state monopoly and awarded licenses to Telenor (Norway) and Ooredoo (Qatar) in 2013.\n\nThe telecommunications revolution was perhaps the most visible transformation. Mobile SIM card prices fell from approximately $1,500 on the black market to $1.50, and mobile penetration surged from 7% in 2012 to over 105% (SIM penetration) by 2018. The entry of Mytel (a joint venture with Vietnam's Viettel) in 2018 added further competition. Mobile internet leapfrogged fixed-line infrastructure, connecting millions to digital services for the first time.\n\nWestern sanctions were progressively eased as reforms advanced. The EU suspended most sanctions in 2013, and the United States lifted its comprehensive sanctions regime in October 2016 following the NLD's election victory and Aung San Suu Kyi's assumption of power as State Counsellor. International financial institutions including the World Bank, ADB, and IMF re-engaged, providing technical assistance and concessional financing. Japan became the largest bilateral donor, and FDI surged from $1.4 billion in 2010 to $9.5 billion by 2016.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe economic impact of opening was substantial. GDP growth averaged approximately 6.5–7.3% annually between 2012 and 2019, among the fastest rates in Southeast Asia. The poverty rate fell from an estimated 48% in 2005 to 24.8% in 2017, according to the World Bank's Myanmar Living Conditions Survey. Urban areas saw particularly rapid transformation, with Yangon experiencing a construction boom, rising consumer spending, and the emergence of modern retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nThe garment sector exemplified the potential of export-oriented manufacturing. From minimal production in 2010, garment exports reached $5.6 billion by 2019, with the sector employing an estimated 700,000 workers, predominantly young women from rural areas. The EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) provided duty-free access that attracted investment, and Myanmar began to position itself as an alternative to China and Bangladesh for cost-sensitive apparel manufacturing.\n\nHowever, the Rohingya crisis cast a deepening shadow. The military's campaign of mass atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State, particularly the 2017 operations that displaced over 700,000 people to Bangladesh, drew international condemnation and threatened the reform narrative. The United States reimposed targeted sanctions on military commanders, and foreign investors began reassessing country risk.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe February 1, 2021 military coup, which overthrew the elected NLD government and detained Aung San Suu Kyi, shattered the reform trajectory. The World Bank estimated that GDP fell approximately 18% in fiscal year 2021 as the economy was devastated by political instability, a civil disobedience movement that paralyzed the banking system, COVID-19, and armed conflict that spread across the country. Western nations reimposed sanctions, major foreign investors withdrew or suspended operations, and the banking system effectively collapsed for months.\n\nEven before the coup, the reform period's benefits were unevenly distributed. Military-linked conglomerates, particularly Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), retained dominant positions in key sectors. The telecommunications revolution, while transformative, also enabled the military's surveillance and information control capabilities. Crony capitalism proved resilient, and the regulatory environment remained opaque and subject to arbitrary intervention. The experience demonstrated both the potential for rapid economic catch-up in post-isolation economies and the fragility of reforms that do not fundamentally alter military-dominated power structures.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Economic opening after prolonged isolation can generate rapid growth, but sustainability depends on genuine political transformation, not merely liberalization managed by authoritarian institutions.\n- Telecommunications liberalization can be a powerful catalyst for economic and social change, leapfrogging legacy infrastructure, but also creates tools for authoritarian control.\n- FDI surges following sanctions relief can be rapidly reversed by political instability, highlighting the importance of institutional foundations for sustained investment.\n- Export-oriented manufacturing (garments) can provide rapid employment growth but remains vulnerable to political risk and sanctions in fragile states.\n- The Myanmar experience demonstrates that a decade of economic reform can be reversed almost overnight when military institutions retain ultimate political power.\n\n## References\n\n- Turnell, S.
