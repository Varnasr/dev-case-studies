  "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nLaunched on October 2, 2014, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) set out to eliminate open defecation in India — a country where an estimated 550 million people, nearly half the population, defecated in the open as of 2014, accounting for roughly 60% of all open defecation worldwide. Over five years, the program built over 110 million household toilets, constructed 6.1 million community and public toilets, and declared all 36 states and union territories Open Defecation Free (ODF) by October 2, 2019. The total expenditure exceeded ₹1.25 lakh crore. Independent surveys confirm a dramatic reduction in open defecation — from 550 million people to an estimated 50-100 million — but also reveal significant gaps between declared ODF status and actual toilet usage, particularly in northern India. Evidence on health outcomes is mixed: some studies show reductions in diarrhea and child stunting, while others find limited health gains, likely due to incomplete usage and continued environmental contamination. SBM is simultaneously one of the largest behavior change campaigns in history and a cautionary tale about the limits of hardware-first approaches to sanitation. Verdict: A massive infrastructure achievement that significantly reduced but did not eliminate open defecation, with health impact hampered by the gap between toilet construction and consistent toilet use.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nIndia's open defecation crisis was not merely a sanitation problem — it was a public health emergency with profound consequences for child survival, nutrition, and economic productivity. In 2014, according to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), 564 million Indians defecated in the open, representing 59% of all people practicing open defecation globally. No other country came close in absolute numbers.\n\nThe health consequences were devastating. Open defecation contaminates water sources, soil, and food with fecal pathogens (E. coli, rotavirus, helminth eggs). The resulting burden of diarrheal disease killed an estimated 117,000 Indian children under five annually (2015 data). Beyond acute diarrhea, environmental enteropathy — chronic subclinical gut inflammation caused by repeated fecal-oral pathogen exposure — was increasingly implicated in India's stubbornly high child stunting rates. In 2015-16 (NFHS-4), 38.4% of Indian children under five were stunted — worse than many poorer Sub-Saharan African countries, a puzzle known as the 'Asian Enigma' or 'Indian Sanitation Puzzle.' Research by Dean Spears and others at the Research Institute for Compassionate Economics (r.i.c.e.) demonstrated a robust correlation between open defecation density and child stunting across Indian districts, even after controlling for income, diet, and maternal education.\n\nThe economic costs were also large. A World Bank (2006) estimate put the annual economic impact of inadequate sanitation in India at $53.8 billion (6.4% of GDP), accounting for health costs, lost productivity, tourism impacts, and water treatment costs.\n\nPrevious sanitation programs had failed. The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC, 1999) and its rebranded successor, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA, 2012), had spent thousands of crores building toilets that went unused, collapsed, or were repurposed as storage rooms. A 2014 survey by r.i.c.e. in rural North India found that 40% of households with a government-built toilet had at least one member still defecating in the open. The problem was not merely the absence of toilets — it was deeply embedded in social norms, caste practices, and cultural preferences.\n\nThe caste dimension is critical and often understated. In Hindu practice, defecation is considered polluting; the cleaning of human waste was historically assigned to Dalit sub-castes. Many upper-caste rural households resisted having a toilet inside or adjacent to their home, viewing it as polluting their living space. Open defecation was, for some, not a symptom of poverty but a cultural practice with deep roots in notions of purity and pollution. This made sanitation behavior change qualitatively different from, say, promoting handwashing or vaccination.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nSwachh Bharat Mission was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2, 2014 — Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary — with a deadline of October 2, 2019 (Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary). It was framed as a national movement, not merely a government program. Modi himself wielded a broom in a symbolic street-cleaning drive, and celebrities were enlisted to promote the cause.\n\nSBM had two components: SBM-Gramin (rural) under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, and SBM-Urban under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The rural component was the centerpiece, given that open defecation was overwhelmingly a rural phenomenon.\n\n**SBM-Gramin (Rural):** The core strategy was to build Individual Household Latrines (IHHLs) for every household without a toilet. The central government subsidy for each toilet was raised from ₹10,000 (under the earlier NBA) to ₹12,000 (later ₹15,000 in hilly and difficult areas), with states contributing an additional amount. The total subsidy of ₹12,000-15,000 was intended to cover the cost of a basic twin-pit latrine. Gram Panchayats were the implementing unit, with district collectors as the nodal officers.\n\nThe scale was staggering. Between October 2014 and October 2019, the mission built 109.6 million household toilets in rural India. The expenditure on SBM-Gramin alone exceeded ₹95,000 crore. Over 600,000 villages, 700+ districts, and all 36 states and union territories were declared ODF.\n\n**Behavior change communication (BCC).** SBM invested heavily in behavior change campaigns, including Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approaches — where facilitators trigger an emotional response (disgust, shame) in communities by mapping open defecation sites and calculating the volume of fecal matter ingested. The Swachh Bharat brand was ubiquitous — on billboards, in movie theaters (mandatory screening of SBM ads before films), on railway tickets, and in school curricula. District-level Swachh Bharat Preraks (motivators) and community-level Swachhagrahis were deployed to promote toilet construction and use. At its peak, the program had over 500,000 Swachhagrahis.\n\n**Verification and ODF declarations.** States and districts were declared ODF through a multi-stage verification process. After a village self-declared ODF status, a district-level team would verify, followed by a state-level verification and finally a third-party verification conducted by an independent agency. However, the rigor of this verification process was widely questioned.\n\n**SBM-Urban:** In urban areas, the focus was on public and community toilet construction, solid waste management, and the elimination of manual scavenging. The urban component built over 6.1 million household toilets and 620,000 community/public toilet seats.\n\n**SBM Phase 2 (2020-2025):** The second phase, launched in 2020, shifted focus from toilet construction to sustainability — ODF Plus (ensuring continued ODF status plus solid and liquid waste management), fecal sludge management, and greywater treatment. This acknowledged that the first phase had focused disproportionately on hardware (building toilets) over sustained behavior change and waste management.\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism\n\nSBM's theory of change combined hardware provision with behavior change, operating through several channels:\n\n**Supply-side: removing the infrastructure barrier.** The most direct mechanism was simply providing toilets to households that did not have them. The assumption was that a substantial portion of open defecation was driven by lack of access to a toilet, and that once a toilet was built, a significant share of users would adopt it. The subsidy was set at a level intended to cover the basic cost of a twin-pit latrine.\n\n**Demand-side: social norm change.** The program explicitly aimed to shift social norms around defecation from acceptance of open defecation to stigmatization of it. CLTS techniques used emotional triggers — shame, disgust, health fear — to create community-level demand for toilets. ODF declarations were structured as community-wide (village-level) rather than individual achievements, creating social pressure: once a village declared ODF, individuals who continued open defecation faced community disapproval.\n\n**Political prioritization and bureaucratic incentives.** Modi's personal association with SBM and the high-profile October 2019 deadline created intense pressure through the bureaucratic chain. District collectors' performance was evaluated on SBM progress. Chief Ministers competed for ODF declarations. This top-down political pressure was a double-edged mechanism: it drove remarkable speed of execution but also incentivized premature declarations and data fudging.\n\n**Health pathway.** The ultimate health theory of change was: reduced open defecation → reduced fecal contamination of the environment (water, soil, hands, food) → reduced diarrheal disease and environmental enteropathy → reduced child mortality and stunting → improved child cognitive development and long-term productivity.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\n**Toilet construction: achieved at scale.** The headline numbers are undeniable: 109.6 million rural household toilets built, 6.1 million urban toilets, and all states declared ODF by October 2, 2019. India's toilet coverage (as measured by the government's SBMG-MIS portal) went from 39% in October 2014 to nearly 100% by October 2019. The JMP revised its estimates for India's open defecation rate from 44% (2015) to approximately 15% (2020).\n\n**Usage: the critical gap.** The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) 2019-20, conducted by an independent agency, found that 93.1% of households with toilets used them regularly — a figure that, if accurate, suggests impressive adoption. However, independent researchers have found lower usage rates. A 2018 r.i.c.e. survey in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh found that 23% of people in households with a latrine (including SBM-built ones) continued to defecate in the open. Among men — who are more likely to defecate outside — the rate was higher. The discrepancy between government and independent figures partly reflects methodological differences (self-reported vs. observed behavior) and the social desirability bias in answering sanitation questions after a major national campaign.\n\n**Health outcomes: mixed evidence.** The NFHS-5 (2019-21) showed child stunting declining from 38.4% to 35.5% nationally, and diarrhea prevalence declining modestly. However, attributing these improvements specifically to SBM is complicated by simultaneous improvements in nutrition programs, health services, and income growth.\n\nA large-scale evaluation — the Swachh Bharat Mission Impact Evaluation (by 3ie, the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation), covering four states — found that toilet ownership increased by 20 percentage points due to SBM, but open defecation decreased by only 10 percentage points, confirming that construction did not translate one-to-one into usage. This study found no statistically significant impact on child diarrhea or height-for-age z-scores. Other studies, including Hammer and Spears (2016), found earlier toilet-building programs had limited health impact when open defecation continued nearby — because the health gains from sanitation require community-level elimination of open defecation, not just individual toilet adoption.\n\nConversely, a study by Gertler et al. (2021) examining India's aggregate data found that the decline in child mortality between 2014 and 2019 was significantly associated with SBM-driven increases in toilet coverage, estimating that SBM may have averted 60,000-70,000 infant deaths annually. Diarrheal deaths among children under five declined by approximately 24% between 2014 and 2019 according to the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative.\n\n**Twin-pit sustainability.** A positive outcome: the twin-pit latrine design promoted by SBM has proven more durable and appropriate for rural India than the septic tank designs promoted by earlier programs. Twin-pit latrines require emptying only every 3-5 years, and the decomposed material can be safely used as compost. This addressed the practical concern that toilets would become unusable once pits filled.\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**Premature ODF declarations.** The intense political pressure to meet the October 2019 deadline led to widespread premature ODF declarations. Numerous journalistic investigations and independent surveys found villages declared ODF where significant open defecation continued. A 2019 survey by the Centre for Policy Research across five states found that 40% of households in ODF-declared villages had at least one member who sometimes defecated in the open. The declaration process became an exercise in performative compliance — districts and states were incentivized to declare ODF regardless of ground reality.\n\n**Hardware over behavior change.** Despite the rhetoric around behavior change, the overwhelming emphasis — in budget allocation, implementation monitoring, and bureaucratic incentives — was on toilet construction. Of the total SBM-G expenditure, an estimated 85-90% went to toilet construction subsidies, with only 8-10% allocated to Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities. This reflected a classic development trap: it is far easier to count toilets built than to measure and sustain behavior change.\n\n**Quality of construction.** Reports from CAG audits and independent surveys found significant quality issues: toilets built without water supply connections, superstructures without doors (making women reluctant to use them), pits that were too small, and toilets built in inconvenient locations. A 2018 Accountability Initiative survey in six states found that 10% of SBM-built toilets were non-functional, and an additional 10% had no water source within close proximity.\n\n**Coercion and dignity concerns.** In some states, the push for ODF status crossed the line from persuasion into coercion. Reports emerged of village committees imposing fines on people caught defecating in the open, withholding other government benefits from households that refused toilet construction, and public shaming of individuals. The use of 'lota surveillance' — patrols checking for people going to fields early in the morning — raised serious dignity and rights concerns. The line between legitimate behavior change motivation and state coercion was frequently violated.\n\n**Neglect of fecal sludge management.** Phase 1 of SBM focused almost exclusively on toilet construction, with minimal attention to what happens after fecal matter enters the pit. Urban areas faced a growing crisis of fecal sludge that was often dumped untreated into water bodies. Even in rural areas, the eventual need to empty and dispose of pit contents was not systematically planned for. SBM Phase 2 belatedly addressed this gap, but the sludge management infrastructure remains rudimentary in most of India.\n\n**The caste and gender blind spot.** While SBM addressed the hardware dimension of sanitation, it did not fundamentally confront the caste dynamics of sanitation labor. Manual scavenging — the cleaning of human waste by Dalit workers — was officially banned under the 2013 Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, but continued in practice. The National Commission for Safai Karamcharis identified over 58,000 people engaged in hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks as of 2018, with over 340 deaths in sewers/septic tanks between 2019 and 2023. SBM built toilets, but the question of who cleans them — and under what conditions — remains entangled in India's deepest social inequalities.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. Behavior change at population scale requires sustained investment over decades, not campaign deadlines.** The October 2019 deadline created urgency that drove remarkable infrastructure achievement, but it also incentivized premature declarations and underinvestment in the slower, harder work of norm change. Eliminating deeply rooted hygiene behaviors — especially those intertwined with caste and gender — requires generation-level cultural shifts, not five-year campaign cycles. SBM Phase 2's focus on sustainability is the right direction, but the political energy has dissipated.\n\n**2. Community-level saturation matters more than individual toilet access for health outcomes.** The evidence strongly suggests that building one household a toilet in a village where 30% of neighbors still defecate in the open provides limited health benefit to the toilet-owning household. Fecal pathogens spread through the shared environment. This means sanitation interventions must target community-wide elimination of open defecation — and health impact measurement should focus on community-level, not individual-level, outcomes.\n\n**3. Hardware and software must be co-designed, not sequenced.** SBM effectively sequenced toilet construction first and behavior change second. The evidence suggests these should be co-designed: building a toilet alongside a sustained behavior change intervention, community engagement, and post-construction follow-up. Bangladesh's CLTS experience — which achieved lower toilet quality but higher behavior change — offers a useful contrast.\n\n**4. Coercion undermines sustainability.** Where compliance was achieved through shaming, fines, and surveillance, it is likely to erode once the political spotlight moves. Durable behavior change requires intrinsic motivation — health awareness, convenience, dignity — not extrinsic enforcement. Policymakers must resist the temptation of coercion as a shortcut to meeting targets.\n\n**5. Sanitation is a system, not a toilet.** The full sanitation chain — containment, conveyance, treatment, and disposal/reuse of fecal sludge — must be addressed holistically. Building toilets without planning for sludge management creates a deferred crisis. Urban sanitation, in particular, requires massive investment in fecal sludge treatment plants, sewer networks, and safe emptying services.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value | Year/Period |\n|---|---|---|\n| Open defecation prevalence (pre-SBM) | 564 million people | 2014 (JMP) |\n| Household toilets built (rural) | 109.6 million | 2014-2019 |\n| Total SBM-Gramin expenditure | ~₹95,000 crore | 2014-2019 |\n| Subsidy per toilet | ₹12,000-15,000 | 2014-2019 |\n| Villages declared ODF | 600,000+ | By Oct 2019 |\n| Toilet usage rate (govt. survey) | 93.1% | NARSS 2019-20 |\n| Continued open defecation (independent survey, N.

How would you design a sanitation program that weighted behavior change at least equally with hardware provision? What metrics would you use to track progress, and how would you create bureaucratic incentives aligned with sustained usage rather than toilet counts?\n\n2. **Caste, dignity, and sanitation:** Dean Spears and Diane Coffey argue that India's sanitation crisis is fundamentally a caste crisis — that open defecation persists partly because of upper-caste resistance to having a latrine near the home, and that the labor of cleaning is imposed on Dalit communities. If this analysis is correct, can a technocratic toilet-building program like SBM solve the problem without confronting caste? What would a caste-conscious sanitation policy look like?\n\n3. **Campaigns vs. systems:** SBM was designed as a time-bound campaign with a dramatic deadline (Gandhi's 150th birthday). Campaign-mode governance can generate extraordinary speed and political focus, but it also creates perverse incentives (data fudging, premature declarations, coercion) and dissipates once the deadline passes. When is campaign-mode governance appropriate for development challenges, and when does it do more harm than good? Compare SBM with other campaign-mode interventions (China's Great Leap Forward, Bangladesh's CLTS program, global polio eradication)."
