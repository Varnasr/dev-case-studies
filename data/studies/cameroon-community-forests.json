  "content": "## Background\n\nCameroon possesses the second-largest area of tropical rainforest in Africa after the Democratic Republic of Congo, spanning approximately 20 million hectares across the southern and eastern regions. These forests are part of the Congo Basin, the world's second-largest tropical forest block, and are of global significance for biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. However, logging concessions allocated during the colonial and post-colonial periods, primarily to European and Asian timber companies, generated substantial revenue for the state and concession holders while providing minimal benefits to forest-dependent communities.\n\nPrior to 1994, Cameroon's forest governance was highly centralized. The state owned all forests and granted logging concessions with little consultation of local communities, who had customary but legally unrecognized rights to forest resources. Communities experienced the negative externalities of industrial logging, including road damage, watershed degradation, and loss of non-timber forest products, while receiving almost none of the revenue. Corruption in the allocation and management of logging concessions was pervasive, as documented by Global Witness and other watchdog organizations.\n\nThe 1994 Forestry Law (Law No. 94/01) represented a landmark reform, introduced partly in response to international pressure following the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and partly as a condition of World Bank structural adjustment lending. The law established multiple categories of forest classification, including a new \"community forest\" category that for the first time gave rural communities legal rights to manage and benefit from forest resources on non-permanent forest domain lands. This was one of the first community forestry frameworks in the Congo Basin.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nUnder the 1994 law and its 1995 implementing decree, communities could apply to manage forests of up to 5,000 hectares for renewable 25-year periods. The application process required communities to form a legal entity (typically an association or common initiative group), conduct a socio-economic study, develop a Simple Management Plan, and obtain approval from the Ministry of Forests and Wildlife (MINFOF). Once approved, communities could harvest and sell timber and non-timber forest products, retaining revenue for community development purposes.\n\nThe law also established an Annual Forestry Fee (Redevance Forestiere Annuelle, or RFA) redistribution mechanism requiring that a portion of logging taxes paid by industrial concessions be returned to local councils and communities. The formula allocated 50% to the state, 40% to the municipal council, and 10% directly to affected communities. This revenue-sharing mechanism was intended to ensure that communities adjacent to industrial logging operations received tangible financial benefits.\n\nInternational donors and NGOs played significant roles in supporting community forestry implementation. Organizations including the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), the World Resources Institute, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, and various German development cooperation programs provided technical assistance, helped communities navigate the complex application process, and conducted research on outcomes. The application process was widely recognized as bureaucratically burdensome, typically requiring three to five years and external support to complete.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBy 2015, over 400 community forests had been allocated across Cameroon, covering approximately 1.4 million hectares, making it the largest community forestry program in the Congo Basin. The program created a legal framework through which communities could, for the first time, exercise formal management rights over forest resources and generate income from timber harvesting and sale. Assembe-Mvondo (2006) documented how the legal framework represented a significant devolution of resource rights compared to the previous centralized system.\n\nHowever, research consistently revealed deep problems with implementation. Oyono (2005), in influential work published in the journal Development and Change, demonstrated how community forests were frequently captured by local elites, particularly village chiefs, educated community members, and those with connections to external logging operators. Revenue from timber sales was often controlled by a small group of community members rather than being equitably distributed. Oyono found that the most marginalized groups, including women, indigenous Baka (Pygmy) communities, and poorer households, were systematically excluded from decision-making and benefit-sharing.\n\nCIFOR's extensive research program on Cameroon's community forests found that many community forests functioned as \"fronts\" for small-scale commercial logging operations, with external timber operators providing financing and equipment in exchange for access to timber at below-market prices. Ezzine de Blas et al. (2011) found that while communities nominally controlled the forests, asymmetric information, weak negotiating capacity, and dependence on external partners meant that much of the timber value was captured by intermediaries. The environmental outcomes were also mixed, with some community forests experiencing unsustainable harvesting rates.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe bureaucratic complexity of the application process has been a persistent barrier. The requirement for a Simple Management Plan, despite its name, involves technical forestry skills that most communities lack, creating dependence on external consultants and NGOs. Processing times of three to five years, combined with informal costs (widely understood to include bribes to officials at various stages), effectively exclude the poorest and most remote communities from participating. MINFOF's capacity to monitor and support hundreds of community forests across vast geographic areas is severely limited.\n\nThe fundamental tension in Cameroon's community forestry model is between conservation objectives promoted by international donors and the livelihood needs of forest-dependent communities. Communities often prioritize timber revenue over sustainable management, while external stakeholders emphasize conservation outcomes. The 5,000-hectare size limit means that community forests are relatively small compared to industrial concessions, raising questions about ecological viability and economic significance. Indigenous peoples' rights, particularly those of the Baka, remain inadequately protected despite national and international advocacy.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Legal frameworks for community forestry are necessary but insufficient; without addressing power imbalances, bureaucratic barriers, and governance weaknesses, formal rights can be captured by elites to the exclusion of marginalized groups.\n- Elite capture in community resource management is not inevitable but requires deliberate institutional design to ensure inclusive decision-making, transparent financial management, and accountability mechanisms.\n- The bureaucratic complexity of community forestry application processes can become a barrier that reproduces the exclusion the program was designed to address, favoring communities with external connections and resources.\n- Revenue from forest resources can fund community development, but equitable benefit-sharing requires robust governance mechanisms that many communities lack, particularly in contexts of weak state oversight.\n- Community forestry programs must explicitly address the rights of indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups who may be further disadvantaged by community-level governance structures dominated by majority populations.\n\n## References\n\n- Oyono, P.
