  "content": "## Background\n\nAt independence in 1968, Mauritius seemed destined for failure. The small island nation of 1.3 million people, located in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, was heavily dependent on sugar exports, had rapid population growth, high unemployment, and ethnic tensions between its Hindu majority and Creole, Muslim, Chinese, and Franco-Mauritian minorities. James Meade, the Nobel laureate economist who led a 1961 economic mission to the island, painted a gloomy picture, warning that population pressure and sugar dependence would lead to declining living standards. V.S. Naipaul described Mauritius as an \"overcrowded barracoon.\"\n\nThe pessimism seemed well-founded. Sugar accounted for over 90% of export earnings, and the sugar sector was controlled by a small Franco-Mauritian planter elite. The economy was highly vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and weather shocks. The island had no significant mineral resources, limited arable land, and was geographically remote from major markets. Ethnic diversity, rather than being seen as an asset, was viewed as a potential source of violent conflict, as communal riots in 1968 underscored.\n\nYet Mauritius defied these predictions spectacularly. By the 2010s, it had achieved upper-middle-income status with a GDP per capita exceeding $12,000, a diversified economy spanning sugar, textiles, financial services, tourism, and ICT, a functioning democracy with regular transfers of power, and a welfare state providing free education, healthcare, and pensions. Subramanian and Roy (2003) described Mauritius as perhaps the most remarkable development success in Sub-Saharan Africa, demanding explanation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Act of 1970 was the pivotal policy intervention that launched Mauritius's industrial transformation. Inspired by models in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the EPZ offered tax holidays, duty-free imports of raw materials, preferential access to credit, and streamlined customs procedures to firms producing goods for export. Unlike many other developing countries that established geographically bounded export processing zones, Mauritius allowed any firm anywhere on the island to register for EPZ status, effectively making the entire country a free trade zone for export-oriented manufacturing.\n\nThe EPZ initially attracted investment primarily in textile and garment manufacturing, leveraging Mauritius's preferential access to European markets under the Lome Convention and later the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which allocated quotas for textile imports from developing countries. Local Sino-Mauritian business networks provided crucial entrepreneurial capital, while Hong Kong investors brought technical knowledge of garment manufacturing. The combination of trade preferences, domestic entrepreneurship, and foreign investment created a rapid expansion of labor-intensive manufacturing that absorbed surplus labor from the sugar sector.\n\nRomer (1993) highlighted Mauritius as a case study in the role of trade policy and ideas in development, arguing that the EPZ model succeeded because it created an open sector within an otherwise protected economy, allowing the country to capture gains from trade while maintaining political support from import-competing interests. Subramanian and Roy (2003) emphasized the role of institutions, including democratic governance, rule of law, and property rights, in creating the credible commitment to investors that sustained EPZ growth over decades.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe results were transformational. EPZ employment grew from near zero in 1971 to approximately 90,000 by the early 2000s, making textiles and garments the largest manufacturing sector. Sugar's share of exports fell from over 90% in 1970 to less than 25% by 2000. GDP growth averaged approximately 5-6% annually through the 1980s and 1990s, and unemployment fell from over 20% in the early 1980s to under 5% by the late 1990s, at which point labor shortages actually emerged and the country began importing workers from Madagascar, Bangladesh, and China.\n\nCrucially, Mauritius did not stop at textiles. As the MFA quotas were phased out in 2005, exposing the textile sector to Chinese competition, the government had already begun promoting diversification into financial services, tourism, and information technology. The financial services sector, leveraging Mauritius's network of double taxation avoidance agreements (particularly with India), grew rapidly to contribute approximately 12% of GDP. Tourism expanded to over 1.4 million arrivals annually by 2019, and the ICT/BPO sector created approximately 25,000 jobs.\n\nSubramanian and Roy (2003) attributed Mauritius's success to a combination of factors: favorable initial conditions including sugar sector rents that were redistributed through social spending, strong institutions inherited from the colonial period and strengthened after independence, heterodox trade policies that combined openness in the EPZ with protection of the domestic market, and a social compact across ethnic groups that ensured inclusive growth. The country's HDI reached 0.804 by 2019, ranking 66th globally and first in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Mauritian model faces 21st-century challenges. The textile sector has contracted significantly since the end of MFA quotas, with employment falling from 90,000 to approximately 50,000. The financial services sector's dependence on double taxation agreements, particularly with India, is vulnerable to policy changes, as demonstrated when India began renegotiating its treaty in 2016. Mauritius has appeared on various watchlists regarding tax practices, with the EU gray-listing it in 2020 for anti-money laundering deficiencies.\n\nIncome inequality has grown, with the Gini coefficient rising from approximately 0.37 in 2007 to 0.40 in 2017. An aging population and declining fertility rate create fiscal pressures on the pension and healthcare systems. The country's vulnerability to climate change, including sea-level rise and extreme weather events, poses an existential long-term risk to tourism and coastal infrastructure. Critics including Meisenhelder (1997) have argued that the Mauritian miracle was enabled by specific historical conditions, including sugar preferential prices, MFA quotas, and Cold War geopolitics, that cannot be replicated.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Export processing zones can catalyze industrial transformation when combined with entrepreneurship, foreign investment, trade preferences, and strong institutions, as the Mauritian experience demonstrates.\n- Successful diversification requires proactive policy to develop new sectors before existing competitive advantages erode, as Mauritius's sequential shift from sugar to textiles to services illustrates.\n- Democratic governance and inclusive social policies, including free education and healthcare, can build the broad-based human capital and political stability needed for sustained growth.\n- Small island economies can overcome size constraints through strategic niche positioning in global markets, but must continuously adapt as external conditions change.\n- The role of trade preferences (Lome Convention, MFA) in Mauritius's success raises questions about replicability, as current WTO rules make such preferential arrangements less available to other developing countries.\n\n## References\n\n- Subramanian, A., & Roy, D.
