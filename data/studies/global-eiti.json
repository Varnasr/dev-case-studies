  "content": "## Background\n\nThe \"resource curse\" describes the paradox whereby countries rich in natural resources often experience worse economic performance, higher corruption, and weaker governance than resource-poor countries. Seminal research by Sachs and Warner (1995) and Ross (1999) documented that resource wealth was associated with slower growth, authoritarian governance, and civil conflict. Revenue from extractive industries flowed to governments without passing through domestic taxation systems, weakening the social contract between citizens and the state.\n\nBy the early 2000s, high-profile cases of resource revenue mismanagement in Nigeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and other countries had attracted international attention. The \"Publish What You Pay\" campaign, launched by George Soros and Global Witness in 2002, called on extractive companies to disclose payments to governments. This advocacy created momentum for an international transparency standard.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was announced by UK Prime Minister Tony Blair at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002 and formally launched in 2003. The EITI established a global standard requiring governments to disclose revenues received from oil, gas, and mining companies, and requiring companies to disclose payments made to governments. These disclosures are reconciled by an independent administrator, and the resulting reports are published.\n\nThe EITI operates through a multi-stakeholder model at both international and national levels. Each implementing country establishes a multi-stakeholder group (MSG) comprising government officials, extractive company representatives, and civil society organizations. The MSG oversees the reporting process, validates data, and ensures that EITI requirements are met.\n\nThe EITI Standard has evolved significantly since 2003. The 2013 Standard expanded requirements to include contract transparency, beneficial ownership disclosure, and reporting on the allocation of revenues. The 2019 Standard further strengthened requirements for systematic disclosure, gender and environmental reporting, and engagement with civil society. By 2023, the standard required disclosure of beneficial owners of extractive companies and environmental payments.\n\nThe validation process assesses whether countries meet EITI requirements. Countries that fail to meet the standard can be suspended or delisted. Notable suspensions have included Yemen (due to conflict) and Azerbaijan (due to civil society restrictions). The United States joined EITI in 2011 but withdrew in 2017.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe EITI has achieved significant transparency gains. Over $3 trillion in government revenues from extractive industries have been disclosed through EITI reports, making previously opaque revenue flows visible to citizens, journalists, and researchers. In countries like Nigeria, where oil revenues had been notoriously opaque, EITI reporting revealed significant discrepancies between what companies reported paying and what government agencies reported receiving.\n\nSovacool et al. (2016) conducted a comprehensive evaluation of EITI's impact, analyzing governance outcomes across implementing and non-implementing countries. They found that EITI membership was associated with modest improvements in corruption perceptions and regulatory quality, but the effects were small and not consistently statistically significant. The authors concluded that transparency alone was insufficient to transform governance without complementary accountability mechanisms.\n\nKasekende, Abuka, and Strand (2016) examined EITI's impact on resource governance in Africa and found limited evidence that EITI implementation reduced corruption or improved economic outcomes. They argued that the initiative addressed only one dimension of the resource curse (information asymmetry) while leaving deeper structural problems, including weak institutions, patronage networks, and limited civic capacity, largely untouched.\n\nPositive case studies exist, however. In Mongolia, EITI reporting contributed to public debate about mining revenues and influenced the design of the country's fiscal stabilization fund. In Ghana, EITI data informed civil society advocacy for better management of oil revenues from the Jubilee field.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe most fundamental critique is that transparency does not automatically translate into accountability. Disclosed information is only useful if citizens and civil society have the capacity and freedom to use it to hold governments accountable. In many EITI countries, civic space is restricted, media is constrained, and institutions for accountability are weak.\n\nThe multi-stakeholder model faces challenges in countries where government dominance limits civil society participation. Azerbaijan's experience, where the government restricted NGO activity while maintaining EITI membership, illustrated how the initiative could provide a veneer of transparency without genuine accountability.\n\nCompliance costs can be significant, particularly for smaller countries with limited administrative capacity. The process of producing EITI reports requires considerable technical expertise and coordination across government agencies, which may divert resources from other governance priorities.\n\nCritics have also questioned whether the focus on revenue transparency addresses the most important governance challenges in extractive industries, such as contract negotiation, environmental regulation, revenue allocation, and sub-national governance, areas where the EITI Standard has only recently expanded.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Transparency is necessary but not sufficient for accountability; complementary institutions and civic capacity are essential\n- Multi-stakeholder governance models can promote dialogue but may be captured by dominant actors, particularly governments\n- Global standards create peer pressure and benchmarking but cannot substitute for domestic political will\n- Revenue transparency initiatives must be paired with efforts to strengthen civil society capacity to use disclosed information\n- Incremental expansion of disclosure requirements (contracts, beneficial ownership, environmental payments) can deepen impact over time\n\n## References\n\n1.
