  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the 1990s, Peru's major cities — particularly Lima, which had grown from 2 million to 7 million inhabitants between 1960 and 1995 — were surrounded by vast informal settlements known as pueblos jóvenes (young towns) or asentamientos humanos (human settlements). These communities, often established through organized land invasions on desert hillsides or public land, housed millions of people who lacked formal property titles to the land they occupied, often for decades.\n\nHernando de Soto, Peru's most internationally influential economist, argued in his landmark works — *The Other Path* (1986) and *The Mystery of Capital* (2000) — that the lack of formal property rights was the fundamental obstacle to economic development for the poor. He estimated that informal property in developing countries represented \"dead capital\" worth over $9 trillion globally — assets that could not be leveraged for loans, sold in formal markets, or used as a basis for investment because they existed outside the legal system. Formalizing property rights, de Soto argued, would unlock this capital and transform the economic prospects of the poor.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nIn 1996, President Alberto Fujimori established COFOPRI (Comisión de Formalización de la Propiedad Informal), a streamlined agency dedicated to titling informal urban properties. The program was designed with significant input from de Soto's Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) and received substantial World Bank financing.\n\nCOFOPRI dramatically simplified the titling process, which under previous arrangements had required navigating multiple agencies over several years. The agency used aerial photography and cadastral mapping to identify informal settlements, conducted community-level verification of occupancy, resolved boundary disputes through community assemblies, and issued formal titles registered in the public registry (SUNARP). The entire process was designed to be completed within months rather than years, and the cost to beneficiaries was heavily subsidized.\n\nThe program operated on a supply-driven, mass-titling approach: COFOPRI proactively identified and entered informal settlements rather than waiting for individual applications. This approach enabled rapid scaling — over 1.6 million titles were issued between 1996 and 2006, covering the majority of Lima's pueblos jóvenes and extending to cities across the country.\n\nA key expectation was that formal titles would enable the poor to access formal credit by using their properties as collateral, creating a virtuous cycle of investment, income growth, and poverty reduction — the core of de Soto's thesis.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nField (2007) published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics produced one of the most influential findings from the program. Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting the staggered rollout of titling across Lima neighborhoods, she found that titling did not primarily increase credit access as de Soto predicted. Instead, its main impact was on labor supply: titled households increased their total labor hours by approximately 17 hours per week. The mechanism was a security-of-tenure effect — families no longer needed to have a member constantly present at home to guard against eviction or encroachment, freeing up time for work outside the settlement.\n\nGaliani and Schargrodsky (2010), studying a natural experiment in Buenos Aires (where a similar titling program was implemented), found comparable results: titling improved housing investment (beneficiaries invested more in their homes) and reduced household size, but had limited effects on credit access. These cross-country findings reinforced the conclusion that the de Soto credit channel was weak.\n\nCalderon (2004) documented that COFOPRI titling was associated with improved housing conditions — titled households were more likely to invest in permanent construction materials, connect to water and sewer networks, and make structural improvements. This wealth-building through housing investment, rather than credit-financed entrepreneurship, appeared to be the primary economic mechanism.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fundamental critique centered on the credit access hypothesis. Banks did not rush to lend against newly titled informal properties for several practical reasons: property values in pueblos jóvenes were too low to justify the transaction costs of formal mortgage lending; foreclosure on poor households was socially and politically difficult; and the informal incomes of property holders could not be documented for creditworthiness assessment. The \"mystery of capital\" remained largely unresolved.\n\nMitchell (2007) and others critiqued de Soto's broader framework, arguing that it reduced complex poverty dynamics to a single institutional failure (lack of titles) while ignoring structural issues of inequality, labor market exclusion, and inadequate public services. The titling program did not address the underlying reasons for informality — low incomes, segmented labor markets, and weak urban planning.\n\nThere were also concerns about the program's interaction with urban governance. By regularizing informal occupation ex post, COFOPRI potentially incentivized future land invasions — a moral hazard problem that complicated urban planning efforts. Some analysts noted that titled properties in poorly located settlements (lacking infrastructure, on unstable terrain) had limited value regardless of their formal status.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Land titling programs can be implemented at scale relatively quickly using mass-titling approaches with community verification, but their economic impacts differ from theoretical predictions\n- The primary benefit of titling may be security of tenure (reducing the need to guard property) rather than credit access, as formal lenders may not serve titled but low-income households\n- Housing investment responses to titling are real but modest; the \"unlocking dead capital\" thesis overstates the transformative potential of formalization alone\n- Titling programs should be integrated with complementary urban services (water, sanitation, transport) to generate meaningful improvements in living conditions\n- Influential development theories can drive large-scale policy interventions; rigorous evaluation is essential to distinguish actual from predicted impacts\n\n## References\n\n1.
