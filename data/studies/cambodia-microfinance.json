  "content": "## Background\n\nCambodia's microfinance sector emerged in the early 1990s from humanitarian programs established during the country's post-conflict recovery. International NGOs including CARE, Catholic Relief Services, and Concern Worldwide established village-level credit programs to support rural livelihoods in a country where the formal banking system had been destroyed during the Khmer Rouge era. These programs provided small loans—typically $50–$200—to poor households for agricultural inputs, livestock, and petty trade.\n\nThe most significant early institution was ACLEDA (Association of Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies), established in 1993 with UNDP support, which grew from an NGO microlending program into Cambodia's largest commercial bank. This trajectory from NGO to regulated financial institution set the pattern for the sector's commercialization. By the late 1990s, the National Bank of Cambodia had established a regulatory framework for microfinance institutions (MFIs), and the sector began attracting commercial capital.\n\nThe transformation accelerated in the 2000s as international investors—including microfinance investment vehicles (MIVs), development finance institutions, and private equity funds—poured capital into Cambodian MFIs, attracted by high returns and the narrative of poverty reduction through financial inclusion. Institutions including Prasac, LOLC, and Hattha Bank grew rapidly, and the aggregate loan portfolio expanded from approximately $1 billion in 2010 to over $16 billion by 2023. Average loan sizes grew from a few hundred dollars to over $5,700—extraordinarily large relative to Cambodia's per capita GDP of approximately $1,800.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe microfinance sector in Cambodia is more accurately described as an emergent phenomenon than a deliberate intervention, though regulatory decisions and international investment significantly shaped its development. The National Bank of Cambodia licensed MFIs under a 2007 law, requiring minimum capital standards, reporting, and deposit-taking approval for qualified institutions. However, regulation focused primarily on institutional soundness rather than borrower protection, enabling rapid portfolio growth.\n\nIn 2017, responding to growing concerns about predatory lending, the National Bank imposed an interest rate cap of 18% per annum—down from effective rates that had often exceeded 30%. While intended to protect borrowers, the cap had mixed effects: it reduced interest income for MFIs, potentially leading them to increase loan sizes (to maintain profitability) and to shift away from the smallest, most expensive-to-serve borrowers toward larger, more profitable loans.\n\nInternational development actors played a dual role. The IFC, FMO (Dutch development finance institution), and other DFIs provided both equity and debt capital to major Cambodian MFIs, lending legitimacy and enabling rapid scale-up. At the same time, development organizations increasingly raised alarms about over-indebtedness. Green and Estes (2019) conducted research for MIMOSA (Microfinance Index of Market Outreach and Saturation) showing that Cambodia's microfinance penetration had reached levels associated with severe over-indebtedness crises in other countries.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe sector undeniably expanded financial access. From a country with virtually no formal financial services in rural areas in the early 1990s, Cambodia by 2023 had 2.8 million active microfinance borrowers in a population of roughly 17 million—a penetration rate among the highest in the world. Financial inclusion metrics improved dramatically, with access to formal savings accounts, insurance products, and mobile money services all expanding alongside credit.\n\nHowever, the debt crisis that emerged was severe. LICADHO (Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights) published multiple reports documenting cases where borrowers unable to repay loans were pressured into selling land—often their only productive asset—to meet repayment obligations. A 2019 LICADHO report found that 1 in 4 microfinance borrowers surveyed had sold land to repay debts, and many had reduced food consumption or withdrawn children from school. The average outstanding debt per borrower was approximately $4,000—more than two years' income for many rural households.\n\nGreen and Estes (2019) found that Cambodia's credit-to-GDP ratio in the microfinance sector was the highest in the world, far exceeding levels at which other countries had experienced crises. The combination of high penetration, large loan sizes, land-collateralized lending, and weak consumer protection created what critics described as a systemic over-indebtedness crisis affecting millions of Cambodians.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe use of land titles as collateral has been particularly controversial. Cambodia's Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP), supported by the World Bank, issued millions of land titles from the early 2000s—titles that were then used as collateral for increasingly large microfinance loans. Critics argue that the formalization of land rights, intended to provide tenure security, instead facilitated land dispossession when borrowers defaulted. The pattern of borrowing against land, inability to repay, and forced land sale has been described as a form of accumulation by dispossession.\n\nThe commercialization of microfinance raised fundamental questions about whether profit-driven lending to the poor serves development objectives. Cambodian MFIs have been among the most profitable financial institutions in the developing world, with returns on equity exceeding 20% for major institutions. International investors earned substantial returns, while borrowers bore the risks of over-indebtedness. The sector illustrates the tension between financial inclusion as a development goal and financial inclusion as a commercial opportunity, and the potential for the latter to undermine the former when consumer protection is weak.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Rapid microfinance sector growth without adequate consumer protection can create systemic over-indebtedness crises that harm the very populations the sector is intended to serve.\n- The commercialization of microfinance changes institutional incentives, shifting focus from poverty reduction to portfolio growth and profitability, with potentially harmful consequences for borrowers.\n- Land-collateralized lending to poor households carries high risks of dispossession when loan sizes exceed repayment capacity, particularly in contexts where alternative income sources are limited.\n- Interest rate caps may have unintended consequences, including increased loan sizes and exclusion of the smallest borrowers, if not accompanied by broader consumer protection measures.\n- Development finance institutions bear responsibility for the outcomes of sectors they fund and should integrate borrower protection into their investment criteria alongside institutional performance metrics.\n\n## References\n\n- Green, W.
