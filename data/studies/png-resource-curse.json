  "content": "## Background\n\nPapua New Guinea possesses extraordinary natural resource wealth—gold, copper, oil, natural gas, nickel, and timber—yet remains one of the least developed countries in the Pacific region. With a population of approximately 10 million spread across some of the world's most rugged and linguistically diverse terrain (over 800 languages), PNG has struggled to translate resource revenues into broad-based development since independence in 1975.\n\nThe resource sector dominates the formal economy, accounting for roughly 26% of GDP and 75% of merchandise exports, but directly employs only about 2% of the labor force. Approximately 80% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas dependent on subsistence agriculture, with limited access to health services, education, and infrastructure. The Human Development Index ranking of 155th out of 191 countries in 2022 starkly illustrates the disconnect between resource wealth and human development.\n\nThe resource curse dynamics were established early. The Panguna copper mine on Bougainville, operated by Bougainville Copper Ltd (a Rio Tinto subsidiary), generated enormous revenues from 1972 but distributed benefits inequitably, with environmental damage to local river systems and minimal benefits reaching landowner communities. Grievances over the mine's impacts catalyzed the Bougainville crisis (1988–1998), a civil conflict that killed an estimated 15,000–20,000 people and led to the mine's closure and an eventual independence referendum.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe PNG LNG project, which reached final investment decision in 2009 and began production in 2014, represented the largest single investment in PNG's history. The $19 billion project, led by ExxonMobil with partners including Santos, Oil Search (now Santos), and the PNG government (through Kumul Petroleum Holdings), was designed to extract gas from the Southern Highlands and Western Province, liquefy it at a plant near Port Moresby, and export it primarily to Asian markets.\n\nThe project included extensive benefit-sharing arrangements, at least on paper. Landowner groups in the project area were promised royalty payments, equity participation through landowner companies, infrastructure development, and preferential employment. The government committed to channeling a significant portion of tax and royalty revenues into development programs through a Sovereign Wealth Fund, established by the Organic Law on the Sovereign Wealth Fund in 2012.\n\nChand and Yala (2012) analyzed the governance challenges of managing resource revenues in PNG, arguing that the country's institutional weaknesses—including patronage-based politics, weak public financial management, and limited state capacity in rural areas—made it unlikely that LNG revenues would be effectively translated into development outcomes without fundamental governance reforms.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe PNG LNG project's production performance exceeded initial projections, producing over 8 million tons of LNG per year against nameplate capacity of 6.9 million tons. However, the development benefits have been deeply disappointing. The promised Sovereign Wealth Fund was never properly capitalized, and government revenues from the project were lower than projected due to a combination of low gas prices, generous tax concessions, and the complex revenue-sharing structure.\n\nThe anticipated landowner benefits largely failed to materialize. Reports by Jubilee Australia Research Centre (2018) documented that landowner communities in the project area remained in severe poverty, with promised infrastructure, royalty payments, and business development support either delayed or never delivered. Clan identification and landowner registration—prerequisite steps for benefit distribution—were plagued by disputes, fraud, and political manipulation.\n\nAt the macroeconomic level, GDP growth during the construction phase (2010–2013) was impressive, reaching 13.3% in 2014, but much of this reflected the direct impact of construction spending rather than broader economic transformation. Once the construction workforce departed, growth slowed sharply. The non-resource economy remained stagnant, and services delivery continued to deteriorate, with PNG recording some of the worst maternal mortality, child malnutrition, and primary school completion rates in the Pacific.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Ok Tedi mine disaster serves as PNG's most prominent cautionary tale about resource governance. BHP's Ok Tedi copper-gold mine in Western Province discharged approximately 80,000 tons of tailings and waste rock daily into the Ok Tedi and Fly River systems from 1984, contaminating approximately 1,500 square kilometers of downstream environment and devastating the livelihoods of 50,000 downstream villagers. BHP withdrew from the mine in 2001, transferring its stake to the PNG Sustainable Development Program—a trust intended to fund development in Western Province—but environmental damage continued under subsequent operators.\n\nPNG's political economy of resource governance remains deeply problematic. The District Services Improvement Program (DSIP), which channels funds to parliamentarians for constituency development, has been widely criticized as a vehicle for patronage rather than systematic development. Resource revenues that reach the government budget are frequently absorbed by a public service wage bill that consumes over 50% of government expenditure, leaving minimal funding for service delivery and infrastructure maintenance. The structural challenge is that resource projects operate as enclaves with limited linkages to the domestic economy, while the state lacks the capacity and accountability mechanisms to effectively redistribute resource wealth.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Resource wealth in contexts of weak governance, fragmented political systems, and limited state capacity is unlikely to drive broad-based development without fundamental institutional reforms.\n- Landowner benefit-sharing arrangements require robust identification processes, transparent governance structures, and independent monitoring to deliver promised benefits.\n- Enclave resource projects generate limited employment and local economic linkages; deliberate policy is needed to build downstream industries and economic diversification.\n- Environmental damage from extractive industries can impose costs on downstream communities that far exceed the benefits they receive, making environmental regulation and enforcement essential.\n- Sovereign wealth funds and fiscal rules are ineffective without the political will and institutional capacity to implement them; legislating a fund does not guarantee it will function.\n\n## References\n\n- Chand, S., & Yala, C.
