  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the aftermath of Mexico's 1994–95 peso crisis, poverty surged to affect over 60% of the population. Existing food subsidy programs — particularly the general tortilla subsidy and LICONSA milk distribution — were poorly targeted, expensive, and largely benefited urban consumers rather than the rural extreme poor. Santiago Levy, then Deputy Minister of Finance, argued that generalized subsidies were regressive and proposed a radical alternative: direct cash transfers to poor families conditional on investments in their children's human capital.\n\nLevy's design drew on emerging economic theory about poverty traps — the idea that poor families underinvest in education and health not due to irrationality but because they face binding credit constraints and high opportunity costs of schooling. By offsetting these costs, conditional transfers could break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nProgresa (Programa de Educación, Salud y Alimentación) launched in 1997, initially targeting 300,000 families in rural communities with high marginalization indices. The program provided cash grants conditional on three requirements: children's regular school attendance (at primary and secondary levels), family visits to health clinics for preventive care and nutrition monitoring, and attendance at health education talks (pláticas).\n\nEducation grants increased with grade level and were higher for girls than boys at the secondary level — a deliberate design choice reflecting girls' higher dropout rates. Nutrition supplements were provided for children under 5 and pregnant/lactating women. Transfers were paid to mothers, following evidence that women allocate resources more effectively toward children.\n\nCrucially, Levy insisted on building rigorous evaluation into the program's design from inception. The initial rollout used a randomized phase-in design across 506 communities in seven states: 320 communities received the program immediately, while 186 served as controls for 18 months before also receiving benefits. This created one of the largest social experiments ever conducted, generating an unprecedented evidence base.\n\nThe program expanded rapidly: rebranded as Oportunidades in 2002 under the Fox administration, it extended to urban areas and reached 5 million families by 2004. Under the Peña Nieto government, it became Prospera in 2014, adding productive inclusion and financial literacy components, eventually reaching 6.8 million families.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nSchultz (2004) in the American Economic Review, using the randomized evaluation data, found that Progresa increased enrollment rates by 3.4 percentage points for boys and 3.6 percentage points for girls at the secondary level. The largest effects were at the transition from primary to secondary school, where dropout rates were historically highest.\n\nSkoufias (2005) in a comprehensive IFPRI review found that the program reduced the poverty gap by 36% in participating communities, increased food consumption by 11%, and significantly improved child nutrition — with height-for-age gains of approximately 1 cm among children aged 12–36 months. Gertler (2004) found a 12% reduction in illness among children aged 0–5.\n\nBehrman, Parker, and Todd (2011) assessed longer-term impacts, finding that the first cohort of Progresa beneficiaries completed 0.6–0.9 additional years of schooling. Parker and Todd (2017) in the Journal of Political Economy documented sustained medium-term effects: beneficiary youth had higher educational attainment, were more likely to work in the formal sector, and earned higher wages.\n\nThe program's global influence was extraordinary. By the 2010s, more than 60 countries had implemented CCT programs directly inspired by Progresa's design and evidence, including Brazil's Bolsa Família, Colombia's Familias en Acción, and numerous programs in Africa and Asia.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nSeveral limitations emerged over time. Levy himself (2006) argued that Progresa's conditional approach was undermined by the low quality of schools and health facilities available to beneficiaries — increasing attendance at poorly resourced schools might not generate the human capital gains envisioned. This \"supply-side\" gap remained inadequately addressed throughout the program's life.\n\nTargeting errors persisted: Coady (2000) estimated inclusion errors of approximately 30%, with some non-poor families receiving benefits while some eligible families were excluded. The program's rural design was less effective when extended to urban areas with different poverty dynamics.\n\nIn 2019, President López Obrador terminated Prospera and replaced it with unconditional transfer programs, including Becas Benito Juárez for students and Sembrando Vida for rural workers. This decision, made without a transition plan, disrupted support for millions of families and abandoned the conditionality and targeting mechanisms that had been central to the program's success and evidence base.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Building randomized evaluation into program design from inception generates invaluable evidence and political sustainability across administrations\n- Conditional cash transfers can effectively increase school enrollment and healthcare utilization, but impacts depend on the quality of available services\n- Paying transfers to mothers and graduating benefits by grade level are design features that can enhance effectiveness\n- Even well-evaluated, internationally acclaimed programs are vulnerable to abrupt political termination\n- The supply-side quality of education and health services is a binding constraint that demand-side interventions alone cannot overcome\n\n## References\n\n1.
