  "content": "## Background\n\nWhen Botswana gained independence from Britain in September 1966, it was ranked as one of the ten poorest countries in the world. The territory had been administered as the Bechuanaland Protectorate with minimal colonial investment: there were only 12 kilometers of paved roads in the entire country, 22 citizens with university degrees, and 100 secondary school graduates. The economy depended almost entirely on cattle herding and remittances from migrant laborers in South African mines. Per capita GDP was approximately $70.\n\nThe discovery of diamonds at Orapa in 1967, just one year after independence, fundamentally altered Botswana's development trajectory. However, diamond wealth alone does not explain Botswana's success. Many resource-rich African countries, including Nigeria, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, experienced economic stagnation or decline despite abundant natural resources, a phenomenon known as the \"resource curse.\" Botswana's distinctive achievement was in translating mineral wealth into broad-based development.\n\nBotswana's pre-colonial political institutions, particularly the kgotla system of consultative governance under Tswana chiefs, provided a foundation for inclusive post-independence politics. The country's founding president, Seretse Khama, and his successors maintained democratic governance, the rule of law, and relatively low levels of corruption.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe centrepiece of Botswana's resource management strategy was the Debswana partnership, established in 1969 between the Government of Botswana and De Beers. The government negotiated a 50-50 joint venture, giving it equal ownership and significant influence over the diamond sector. Over time, the government renegotiated terms to capture an increasing share of diamond rents, ultimately receiving approximately 75-80% of Debswana's profits through a combination of dividends, royalties, and taxes.\n\nFiscal policy was anchored by the Sustainable Budget Index, a rule stipulating that mineral revenues should be invested rather than consumed. Recurrent government expenditure was to be financed from non-mineral revenue, while diamond income funded investment in infrastructure, education, and health. In 1994, the government established the Pula Fund, a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Bank of Botswana, to save excess mineral revenues for future generations and smooth expenditure against commodity price volatility.\n\nThe government invested diamond revenues heavily in public goods. Education spending expanded dramatically: secondary enrollment grew from under 2% at independence to over 70% by the 1990s. Health infrastructure, road networks, and water systems were built across the country. Public administration was professionalized, and Botswana consistently ranked among the least corrupt countries in Africa.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBotswana's growth record is extraordinary. Between 1966 and 1999, real GDP grew at an average of approximately 7.7% per year, making Botswana the fastest-growing economy in the world during that period. Per capita income rose from $70 to over $3,000 by 2000 and exceeded $7,000 by the late 2010s. Poverty rates, while still significant, fell substantially.\n\nAcemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2003), in their influential paper \"An African Success Story: Botswana\" published in *In Search of Prosperity: Analytic Narratives on Economic Growth*, attributed Botswana's success to the combination of good institutions (property rights, democratic governance, constraints on elites) inherited from pre-colonial Tswana political structures and reinforced by post-independence leadership. They argued that institutions, rather than geography or resource endowment per se, explained why Botswana succeeded where other resource-rich African countries failed.\n\nTsie (1996), writing in the *Journal of Southern African Studies*, emphasized the role of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and its alliance with cattle-owning elites and the bureaucracy in maintaining a stable policy environment favorable to investment. The state's legitimacy rested on its ability to deliver public services and economic growth to a broad base, even as political power remained concentrated.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite its achievements, Botswana faces significant challenges. Income inequality remains high, with a Gini coefficient consistently above 0.50, among the highest in the world. Unemployment, particularly among youth, has been persistent, hovering around 20%. The economy remains heavily dependent on diamonds, which are a depleting resource, and diversification into manufacturing, tourism, and services has been slow.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic devastated Botswana from the 1990s onward, with adult prevalence reaching 38% in 2000, among the highest in the world. Life expectancy plummeted from 65 years to below 50 before the rollout of antiretroviral therapy. Some scholars, including Good (2008), have critiqued Botswana's \"exceptionalism\" narrative, pointing to the exclusion of the San (Bushmen) minority, restrictions on press freedom, and the dominance of a single party since independence as evidence of a less democratic reality than the country's reputation suggests.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Institutional quality, particularly constraints on executive power, rule of law, and bureaucratic capacity, is central to avoiding the resource curse.\n- Negotiating favorable terms with extractive industry partners, including majority shares of rents, allows resource-rich countries to capture development benefits.\n- Fiscal rules that separate mineral revenues from recurrent spending can promote sustainable investment and intergenerational equity.\n- Resource wealth can finance transformative investments in human capital and infrastructure, but economic diversification remains essential for long-term sustainability.\n- Good governance at the national level does not automatically address inequality, marginalization of minorities, or vulnerability to health shocks.\n\n## References\n\n- Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., & Robinson, J.
