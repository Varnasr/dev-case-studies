  "content": "## Background\n\nNiger consistently ranks at or near the bottom of the UN Human Development Index, with a HDI of 0.394 in 2019. The country faces recurring climate shocks, including droughts approximately every three to five years, which devastate agricultural livelihoods in a nation where over 80% of the population depends on rain-fed farming and pastoralism. The 2005 and 2010 food crises exposed the inadequacy of reactive humanitarian responses, which arrived too late and failed to protect household assets.\n\nThe Sahel region, stretching across the semi-arid belt south of the Sahara, is among the most climate-vulnerable zones on earth. Niger's population growth rate of approximately 3.8% per year, among the highest globally, compounds the challenge of food security. Traditional coping mechanisms, including livestock sales, reduced food consumption, and migration, were increasingly insufficient against the backdrop of worsening climate variability and demographic pressure.\n\nPrior to the Adaptive Social Protection Programme (ASPP), Niger's social safety net was fragmented and largely driven by humanitarian agencies operating in emergency mode. The government's capacity to deliver regular cash transfers was limited, and there was no systematic mechanism to scale up assistance in response to early warning signals of impending food crises.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe World Bank launched the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Programme in 2014, with Niger as a flagship country. The programme's core innovation was linking routine social protection cash transfers to climate and food security early warning systems, enabling the safety net to expand rapidly when shocks were detected. The Niger component, implemented through the national safety net project (Projet Filets Sociaux), received US$130 million in IDA financing.\n\nThe programme established a national social registry to identify and target chronically poor households using proxy means testing and community-based verification. Beneficiary households received regular unconditional cash transfers of approximately 10,000 CFA francs per month, with accompanying measures including nutrition behavior change communication, cash-for-work during the dry season, and productive inclusion activities such as savings groups and livelihood support.\n\nThe adaptive component worked through pre-agreed triggers linked to food security monitoring systems including the Cadre Harmonisé and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). When indicators crossed predetermined thresholds, the programme could rapidly scale up by increasing transfer values to existing beneficiaries and temporarily enrolling additional vulnerable households identified through the social registry. This approach aimed to bridge the gap between long-term poverty reduction and short-term shock response.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nPremand and Stoeffler (2020) conducted a rigorous impact evaluation using a randomized phase-in design across 96 villages. They found that the cash transfer programme reduced food insecurity by 12 percentage points and increased household consumption by approximately 10%. Beneficiary households were significantly less likely to resort to negative coping strategies such as reducing meal frequency or withdrawing children from school during lean seasons.\n\nThe programme's scalability was tested during the 2018 food crisis, when the system expanded from its regular caseload to provide emergency top-ups to existing beneficiaries in affected areas. The social registry, which by 2020 covered over 3.7 million households across Niger, proved critical for rapid targeting during scale-up. Bossuyt and colleagues at the World Bank documented how the pre-positioning of systems, financing, and data reduced response times compared to traditional humanitarian appeals.\n\nBy 2020, the programme reached approximately 280,000 households with regular transfers, making it one of the largest government-led safety nets in the Sahel. Evidence from related World Bank research by Schnitzer (2019) showed that combining cash transfers with behavioral nudges on nutrition improved child dietary diversity. The programme's productive inclusion components showed promise in building household resilience, though evidence on long-term asset accumulation remained mixed.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite progress, the programme faces substantial challenges. Coverage remains far below need in a country where over 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Political instability, including the 2021 coup, disrupted implementation and raised questions about government ownership. Targeting accuracy is contested, with exclusion errors leaving many vulnerable households without support, and the proxy means test approach has limitations in contexts of widespread poverty.\n\nThe integration between humanitarian and development actors remains incomplete. Coordination between the government safety net, UN agencies, and NGOs is complex, and parallel delivery systems persist. Financing sustainability is a concern, as Niger's domestic revenue capacity is extremely limited and the programme depends heavily on external funding. Climate change projections suggest increasing frequency and severity of shocks, potentially outpacing the programme's adaptive capacity.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Pre-positioning social protection systems, including social registries and payment mechanisms, before crises occur dramatically improves response speed and targeting accuracy.\n- Adaptive social protection that links routine transfers to early warning systems can bridge the humanitarian-development divide, though institutional coordination remains challenging.\n- Cash transfers alone are insufficient for building long-term resilience; complementary interventions in nutrition, livelihoods, and human capital are necessary.\n- Political instability and governance disruptions pose significant risks to programme continuity in fragile Sahelian contexts.\n- Scalable safety nets require sustained financing commitments that are difficult to maintain in low-income countries dependent on donor funding.\n\n## References\n\n- Premand, P., & Stoeffler, Q.
