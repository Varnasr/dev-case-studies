Despite increases in funding and infrastructure, health workers are often absent, essential medicines are unavailable, and patients receive inadequate care. In many countries, only a fraction of pregnant women deliver in health facilities, immunization rates plateau below targets, and preventable deaths from treatable conditions remain common.\n\nTraditional input-based financing, which pays for salaries, supplies, and infrastructure regardless of performance, provides weak incentives for quality and utilization. Health workers receive the same compensation whether they see 10 patients or 100, whether they follow clinical protocols or not. Supply-side constraints (absent staff, stockouts) interact with demand-side barriers (distance, cost, cultural factors) to produce persistently poor health outcomes.\n\nResults-Based Financing (RBF), also known as Performance-Based Financing (PBF), emerged as an approach to address these incentive problems by linking payments to the verified delivery of specified health services and outcomes.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nRwanda became the pioneer of RBF in health, launching a performance-based financing scheme in 2002 in collaboration with international NGOs. The program paid health facilities bonuses based on the quantity and quality of specified services delivered, including institutional deliveries, prenatal care visits, immunizations, growth monitoring, and family planning consultations. A portion of the bonus (typically 25%) was tied to quality scores assessed through quarterly facility evaluations.\n\nThe payment structure was designed to incentivize services with the highest health impact and the largest gap between current delivery and optimal coverage. For example, institutional deliveries received the highest per-unit payment because facility-based delivery was strongly associated with reduced maternal and neonatal mortality but utilization rates were low. Health facilities had autonomy over how to use bonus payments, including investments in infrastructure, supplies, or staff incentives.\n\nThe model attracted significant international attention and support. The World Bank established the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) in 2007 with $400 million to support RBF programs in over 30 countries. Major RBF programs were implemented in Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, and Argentina, among others.\n\nProgram designs varied across countries. Some paid individual health workers directly; others paid facilities. Some combined supply-side incentives (payments to providers) with demand-side incentives (conditional cash transfers or vouchers to patients). Quality verification mechanisms ranged from community verification to independent clinical audits.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBasinga et al. (2011), published in *The Lancet*, reported results from a randomized controlled trial of RBF in Rwanda. The study compared health facilities receiving performance-based payments with facilities receiving equivalent unconditional funding increases. The key finding was a 23% increase in institutional deliveries in RBF facilities relative to control facilities, along with significant improvements in preventive care for children. Notably, the effects were concentrated in services with the highest per-unit payments, supporting the mechanism that financial incentives drove behavioral change.\n\nHowever, the study also found no significant effects on several incentivized services, including prenatal care and immunization, suggesting that financial incentives were not uniformly effective across all service categories. The authors hypothesized that services already at relatively high coverage levels had less room for improvement.\n\nRenmans et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review of PBF in low- and middle-income countries. They found that while many studies reported positive effects on targeted service delivery, the quality of evidence was generally weak, with few randomized evaluations and significant risks of bias. They concluded that the evidence base was insufficient to determine whether RBF was more cost-effective than alternative approaches to improving health service delivery.\n\nWitter et al. (2012) raised similar concerns in a Cochrane-protocol systematic review, noting that the rapid scaling of RBF programs had outpaced the evidence base and that implementation contexts varied so dramatically that generalizations were difficult.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nGaming and distortion effects are inherent risks in any incentive-based system. Health workers may focus on incentivized services at the expense of non-incentivized ones (\"teaching to the test\"), inflate reported numbers, or lower quality thresholds. Documentation of gaming has been reported in several RBF programs, though the extent varies.\n\nVerification systems are costly and complex. Independent verification of service delivery, which is essential for the credibility of RBF, requires resources and infrastructure that many health systems lack. In some programs, verification costs consume a significant portion of the overall budget, raising questions about cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe interaction between RBF and health system strengthening is debated. Proponents argue that RBF incentivizes improved management, accountability, and facility autonomy. Critics contend that RBF creates parallel payment systems that fragment health financing and undermine efforts to build unified, equitable health systems. Ireland, Paul, and Dujardin (2011) argued that PBF risked commodifying health services and undermining the intrinsic motivation of health workers.\n\nEquity concerns have been raised about whether RBF disproportionately benefits better-performing facilities (which can more easily meet targets) while leaving the weakest facilities, serving the poorest populations, further behind.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Financial incentives can increase delivery of specific health services, but effects are not uniform across all service types\n- RBF works best when combined with adequate inputs (staff, supplies, infrastructure) rather than as a substitute for basic resource provision\n- Verification systems are essential for credibility but add significant cost and complexity\n- The design of incentive structures matters enormously: which services are incentivized, at what rates, and how quality is measured all affect outcomes\n- RBF should be evaluated against alternative uses of the same resources, including unconditional funding increases, to determine cost-effectiveness\n\n## References\n\n1.
