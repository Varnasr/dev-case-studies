  "content": "## Background\n\nEl Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender emerged from a unique combination of factors: an already dollarized economy with no national currency to protect, massive remittance flows subject to high transaction fees, a young population with low banking penetration (approximately 70% unbanked), and a charismatic populist president seeking international visibility.\n\nPresident Nayib Bukele, elected in 2019 with overwhelming popular support, had already demonstrated a willingness to break with convention and use social media to govern. His announcement of the Bitcoin Law at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami in June 2021 was met with enthusiasm by cryptocurrency advocates, who saw El Salvador as a real-world test case for Bitcoin's utility as money.\n\nThe context of El Salvador's earlier dollarization was relevant: having already surrendered monetary sovereignty by adopting the US dollar, the country had less to lose—in terms of monetary policy—from adding a second legal tender. However, the volatility and technological complexity of Bitcoin posed fundamentally different challenges.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Ley Bitcoin was passed by El Salvador's Legislative Assembly on June 8, 2021, just three days after Bukele's announcement, and took effect on September 7, 2021. The law mandated that all economic agents accept Bitcoin as payment, alongside the US dollar. The government guaranteed instantaneous dollar-to-Bitcoin conversion through a trust fund at the Banco de Desarrollo de El Salvador (BANDESAL), backed by US$150 million.\n\nThe government developed the Chivo digital wallet, distributing US$30 in Bitcoin to each citizen who signed up—a cost of approximately US$120 million at full adoption. The wallet enabled Bitcoin transactions, conversion to dollars, and, crucially, remittance transfers from the United States without the traditional fees charged by services like Western Union (which averaged 3–4% of the transfer amount).\n\nThe government also purchased Bitcoin for its national reserves, accumulating approximately 2,381 BTC through a series of purchases that Bukele personally announced on Twitter. At peak Bitcoin prices, these holdings were valued at over US$150 million, but they fluctuated dramatically with the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAdditional initiatives included a geothermal Bitcoin mining operation powered by volcanic energy near the Tecapa volcano, and a proposed US$1 billion \"Volcano Bond\" (officially titled the \"Digital Securities Law\") to be partially backed by Bitcoin, intended to fund the construction of \"Bitcoin City\" near the Conchagua volcano.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nAlvarez, Argente, and Van Patten (2023), in an NBER working paper, conducted the most rigorous empirical study of Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. Using data from the Chivo wallet and nationally representative surveys, they found that while approximately 4 million Chivo wallets were downloaded (in a country of 6.5 million), active usage declined sharply after the initial US$30 bonus was spent. Only about 20% of the population continued using Bitcoin for transactions after the first few months. Usage was concentrated among younger, male, more educated, and more tech-savvy individuals.\n\nThe study found that Bitcoin was used primarily for small transactions and that the majority of merchants who accepted Bitcoin immediately converted to dollars, suggesting limited genuine adoption as a store of value or medium of exchange. Remittance transfers through Chivo constituted only about 2% of total remittance volume.\n\nThe fiscal risks materialized as Bitcoin's price declined from its November 2021 peak of approximately US$69,000 to below US$17,000 by late 2022. The government's Bitcoin holdings lost an estimated 50–60% of their value, though the amounts involved remained small relative to GDP.\n\nThe IMF consistently opposed the Bitcoin initiative, warning of risks to financial stability, fiscal integrity, and consumer protection. The IMF delayed negotiations for a new lending program, explicitly linking its concerns to the Bitcoin Law. In 2024, El Salvador reached a deal with the IMF for a US$1.4 billion program that included provisions to scale back the Bitcoin initiative—making merchant acceptance voluntary rather than mandatory.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nBitcoin's extreme price volatility fundamentally undermines its utility as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Merchants and consumers face significant exchange rate risk in the time between receiving and spending Bitcoin, creating practical barriers to adoption.\n\nThe technical complexity of cryptocurrency transactions—wallet setup, private key management, transaction fees during network congestion—exceeds the capacity of much of El Salvador's population, particularly the unbanked poor who were supposedly the primary beneficiaries.\n\nTransparency and governance concerns surround the government's Bitcoin purchases and the management of the Chivo trust fund. Bukele's personal Twitter announcements of Bitcoin purchases lacked the institutional accountability expected of sovereign asset management. The Corte de Cuentas (national audit office) has had limited access to information about the Bitcoin-related expenditures.\n\nSecurity concerns emerged when reports of fraud, wallet hacking, and identity theft associated with Chivo wallet accounts surfaced. Some citizens reported that Chivo accounts were opened in their names without consent.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Mandating cryptocurrency as legal tender does not ensure adoption; voluntary usage rates provide a more honest measure of demand\n- Remittance cost reduction through cryptocurrency faces competition from improving traditional money transfer services and from user unfamiliarity with the technology\n- Sovereign Bitcoin purchases represent speculative fiscal policy that introduces unnecessary volatility to public finances\n- International financial institutions impose real constraints on heterodox monetary experiments, particularly for countries dependent on external lending\n- Financial inclusion requires addressing barriers of trust, digital literacy, and infrastructure—technology alone is insufficient\n\n## References\n\n1.
