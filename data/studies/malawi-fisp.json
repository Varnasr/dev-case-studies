  "content": "## Background\n\nMalawi is one of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries, with a predominantly agricultural economy. Over 80% of the population depends on smallholder farming, with maize as the dominant staple crop providing approximately 60% of caloric intake. Average farm sizes are extremely small, typically under one hectare, and declining due to population growth and land subdivision. Soil fertility has been depleted by continuous cultivation without adequate replenishment.\n\nMalawi experienced a severe food crisis in 2001-2002 that resulted in widespread famine and an estimated 1,000-3,000 deaths. The crisis was triggered by floods and drought but exacerbated by the government's sale of its strategic grain reserve and the removal of fertilizer subsidies under structural adjustment conditionality. The episode generated intense debate about the role of agricultural input subsidies, which international financial institutions had discouraged as inefficient and market-distorting.\n\nWhen President Bingu wa Mutharika took office in 2004, he made food self-sufficiency a central political priority. Against the advice of many donors and the World Bank, his government launched a large-scale fertilizer and seed subsidy programme for the 2005/2006 agricultural season, drawing on the work of development economists who argued that poverty traps in African agriculture could be broken through targeted input subsidies.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP) provided coupons to selected smallholder farmers entitling them to purchase two 50-kilogram bags of fertilizer (one basal, one top-dressing) and a quantity of improved maize seed at heavily subsidized prices, typically around 10% of the market price. The programme initially targeted approximately 1.5 million of Malawi's estimated 3 million farming households, with targeting criteria emphasizing resource-poor farmers who could not afford commercial fertilizer.\n\nAt its peak, the programme cost approximately $100 million per year, representing 6-8% of GDP and up to 16% of the government budget. The fiscal burden was substantial for a country that relied heavily on donor aid. Fertilizer was procured through government tenders and distributed through a network of agricultural development divisions, rural markets, and political structures.\n\nThe design reflected both technical agricultural reasoning and political calculation. Maize production required fertilizer to achieve yields substantially above subsistence levels on Malawi's depleted soils, but most smallholders could not afford commercial fertilizer. The programme was also enormously popular politically, and the distribution of coupons became closely linked to electoral politics.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe initial results were dramatic. Maize production approximately doubled from around 1.2 million tonnes in 2004/2005 to 3.4 million tonnes in 2006/2007, transforming Malawi from a food aid recipient to a net food exporter. Dorward, Chirwa, and Jayne (2008), in a widely cited analysis, attributed a significant portion of this increase to the subsidy programme, while noting that favorable rainfall also played a role.\n\nDenning et al. (2009), writing in *Nature*, highlighted Malawi's experience as evidence that targeted input subsidies could break the low-productivity trap in African agriculture, directly challenging the Washington Consensus emphasis on market-based approaches. The case generated global attention and influenced agricultural policy debates across the continent.\n\nHowever, subsequent research painted a more nuanced picture. Chirwa and Dorward's 2013 book, *Agricultural Input Subsidies: The Recent Malawi Experience*, provided the most comprehensive assessment. They found that while the programme significantly increased national maize production and improved food security, cost-benefit ratios were questionable. The programme displaced a significant volume of commercial fertilizer sales (estimated at 20-30%), meaning that the net additional fertilizer use was substantially less than the total subsidized quantity. Targeting leakage was extensive, with better-off farmers frequently receiving coupons intended for the poor.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fiscal sustainability of FISP has been a central concern. At 6-8% of GDP, the programme consumed resources that could have been invested in agricultural research, extension, irrigation, roads, or education. As global fertilizer prices spiked in 2008, the programme's cost escalated sharply. Donors were reluctant to finance what they viewed as an unsustainable recurrent expenditure, and the programme was largely funded from domestic resources, crowding out other public investments.\n\nTargeting problems were pervasive. Coupons were frequently captured by local elites, distributed along political lines, or sold on secondary markets. Jayne et al. (2013) estimated that only about half of subsidized fertilizer reached the intended beneficiaries. The programme also created dependency, discouraging commercial fertilizer market development and leaving farmers vulnerable whenever the subsidy was reduced. Subsequent governments have attempted to reform FISP, reducing its scale and improving targeting, with mixed success.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Targeted input subsidies can dramatically increase food production in the short term, particularly where soil fertility constraints and farmer poverty create low-productivity traps.\n- The fiscal cost of large-scale input subsidies can be unsustainable for low-income countries, particularly when fertilizer prices are volatile.\n- Displacement of commercial sales and elite capture of benefits significantly reduce the cost-effectiveness of subsidy programmes.\n- Political incentives to distribute subsidies broadly can undermine targeting to the poorest and most productive farmers.\n- Input subsidies should be viewed as a transitional measure accompanied by investments in soil health, market development, and agricultural research, not as a permanent substitute for these investments.\n\n## References\n\n- Dorward, A., Chirwa, E., & Jayne, T.
