  "content": "## Background\n\nThe 1993-1995 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) established the Palestinian Authority (PA) as an interim governing body, anticipated to lead to a final status agreement within five years. The international community mobilized massive aid flows to support institution-building, economic development, and the peace process. The Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) coordinated donors, while the World Bank, EU, USAID, and UN agencies implemented programmes across governance, infrastructure, health, education, and private-sector development.\n\nPalestine presented a unique development challenge: an economy operating under military occupation, with movement restrictions, trade controls, resource confiscation, and territorial fragmentation that fundamentally constrained economic activity. The West Bank was divided into Areas A, B, and C under Oslo, with Israel retaining security and civil control over Area C, comprising 60% of the territory. Gaza experienced repeated conflicts and, after Hamas's takeover in 2007, a comprehensive blockade.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe aid architecture encompassed multiple dimensions. Budget support to the PA financed public-sector salaries, health, and education services. Infrastructure investment targeted roads, water, electricity, and public buildings. Institutional development programmes built PA ministries, a security apparatus, and judicial system. UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees established in 1949, continued providing education, health, and social services to 5.9 million registered refugees across the region.\n\nThe World Bank played a coordinating role, producing regular economic monitoring reports and managing trust funds. The EU became the largest single donor, providing over EUR 1 billion annually through various instruments. USAID funded significant development programmes until aid was curtailed in 2019 under the Trump administration. The PA developed a national development planning capacity, producing successive national development plans.\n\nSpecific initiatives included the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (2008-2010), the statehood-building agenda that led to the 2012 UN General Assembly recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer state, and the World Bank's support for the Jenin Industrial Free Zone and other private-sector initiatives.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nLe More (2008) provided the most comprehensive analysis of aid to Palestine, arguing that international assistance had become a substitute for political progress and effectively subsidized the occupation by relieving Israel of its responsibilities as an occupying power under international law. Aid financed infrastructure that was repeatedly destroyed in military operations, creating a cycle of destruction and reconstruction.\n\nTartir (2015) documented how aid increasingly served donor geopolitical interests rather than Palestinian development needs. The security-sector reform programme, for instance, prioritized coordination with Israeli security forces over accountability to Palestinian citizens. The neoliberal economic framework promoted by donors assumed market conditions that were impossible under occupation.\n\nWildeman and Tartir (2014) found that aid failed to arrest economic decline in key periods. The World Bank repeatedly documented \"de-development\" in its reports, noting that the Palestinian economy performed below its potential due to restrictions on movement, access, and trade. GDP per capita in Gaza declined in real terms between 2000 and 2020. The World Bank estimated that occupation restrictions cost the Palestinian economy 35% of potential GDP.\n\nSome institutional achievements were real: the PA built functioning ministries, a central statistics bureau, and education and health systems that delivered services to millions. Palestinian public schools enrolled over 1.2 million students, and health indicators improved substantially.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fundamental critique, articulated by Le More (2008), Tartir (2015), and others, is that aid cannot substitute for political resolution. The expansion of Israeli settlements, the Gaza blockade, and the fragmentation of Palestinian territory rendered development gains fragile or reversible. Every major military operation in Gaza destroyed years of infrastructure investment.\n\nDonor dependency created perverse incentives. The PA became dependent on external budget support, limiting fiscal sovereignty. Aid flows fluctuated based on donor political decisions rather than development needs. The PA's legitimacy was undermined by its perceived dependence on donors and cooperation with Israeli security forces.\n\nThe Palestinian economy remained structurally distorted: a bloated public sector, restricted private sector, and dependence on remittances and aid. The separation of the West Bank and Gaza after 2007 further fragmented governance and economic space. UNRWA faced chronic underfunding, particularly after the US suspended contributions in 2018.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Aid cannot substitute for addressing the political root causes of underdevelopment; development under occupation faces inherent constraints that no amount of financing can overcome\n- High per-capita aid flows can create dependency, distort economic structures, and reduce pressure for political resolution\n- Infrastructure investment in conflict zones is vulnerable to destruction, creating wasteful cycles of reconstruction\n- Donor coordination mechanisms (AHLC) can become forums for managing aid rather than addressing structural constraints\n- Security-sector reform must balance external coordination with domestic accountability\n- Development planning requires sovereignty over territory, resources, and borders\n\n## References\n\n1.
