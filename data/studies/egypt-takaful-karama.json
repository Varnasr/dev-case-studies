  "content": "## Background\n\nEgypt's social protection system was historically dominated by universal subsidies, particularly on food (bread, cooking oil, sugar) and energy (fuel, electricity). By 2013, energy subsidies alone consumed approximately 7% of GDP, while food subsidies cost an additional 2%. These subsidies were highly regressive: the IMF estimated that the wealthiest quintile captured 45% of energy subsidy benefits compared to only 7% for the poorest quintile.\n\nFollowing the 2013 political transition, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's government, supported by the IMF, embarked on a fiscal consolidation programme that included phased reduction of energy subsidies. The November 2016 IMF agreement ($12 billion Extended Fund Facility) was conditioned on subsidy reform, exchange rate liberalization, and VAT introduction. These measures, while fiscally necessary, imposed significant costs on the poor through higher prices and currency depreciation. A compensating social protection mechanism was essential.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Takaful and Karama (Solidarity and Dignity) programme was launched in 2015 with two components. Takaful is a conditional cash transfer (CCT) targeting poor families with children. Transfers range from LE 350 to LE 700 per month per family, with amounts varying based on family composition and the number and educational level of children. Conditions include school attendance (80% minimum), health clinic visits for children under six, and prenatal care for pregnant women.\n\nKarama is an unconditional cash transfer targeting the elderly poor (65+) and persons with severe disabilities who cannot work. The transfer is LE 450 per person per month (as of 2020 adjustments).\n\nTargeting uses a proxy means test (PMT) based on a household survey assessing asset ownership, housing characteristics, demographics, and geographic location. The Ministry of Social Solidarity administers the programme through a unified national registry (the Social Registry) that has grown to cover approximately 100 million records, creating the backbone for Egypt's evolving social protection system.\n\nBreisinger et al. (2018) at IFPRI evaluated the programme's design and found the PMT to be reasonably effective at identifying the poor, though exclusion errors remained significant, with roughly 30% of the poorest quintile initially uncovered.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBy 2022, the programme reached approximately 3.7 million families (roughly 15 million individuals), making it the largest targeted cash transfer in the Middle East and North Africa. The World Bank's Implementation Completion Report documented several achievements: the programme successfully covered approximately 70% of the poorest quintile, transfers were delivered reliably through post offices and electronic payment systems, and compliance with health and education conditions was monitored through improving data systems.\n\nBreisinger et al. (2018) found that Takaful transfers represented a meaningful share of household consumption for the poorest families, approximately 20-25% of total spending. School attendance among beneficiary children showed improvement, though isolating the causal effect of the programme from other factors was methodologically challenging.\n\nThe programme served as a critical buffer during the sharp economic adjustment of 2016-2017, when the currency was floated (losing 50% of its value) and energy prices were raised. Without Takaful and Karama, the poverty impact of these reforms would have been substantially worse. The World Bank estimated that the programme prevented approximately 1 million people from falling into poverty during the adjustment period.\n\nThe social registry infrastructure has become a platform for multiple programmes, including emergency COVID-19 cash transfers in 2020, which used the registry to identify and reach an additional 1.5 million vulnerable households.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nProxy means testing has known limitations. Exclusion errors mean some of the poorest households do not receive transfers, particularly those in hard-to-reach areas or with characteristics not well captured by the PMT formula. The grievance and appeals mechanism is underdeveloped, making it difficult for excluded households to contest decisions.\n\nTransfer values, while meaningful, have not kept pace with inflation. The LE 350-700 monthly range, worth approximately $20-45 at post-float exchange rates, provides subsistence support but is insufficient to lift families out of poverty. Indexing transfers to inflation has been discussed but not systematically implemented.\n\nConditionality enforcement presents challenges. Monitoring school attendance and health visits across 27 governorates requires administrative capacity that remains uneven. Supply-side constraints (quality of schools and health facilities in poor areas) limit the effectiveness of demand-side conditionality.\n\nThe political economy of the programme is complex: it was designed partly to compensate for subsidy cuts, but subsidy reform itself was externally driven by IMF conditionality, raising questions about ownership and sustainability. Civil society participation in programme design and oversight has been limited in Egypt's restricted civic space.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Cash transfer programmes can mitigate the poverty impact of fiscal adjustment (subsidy reform, currency devaluation) but must be scaled and valued adequately\n- Proxy means testing enables rapid targeting but generates exclusion errors that require robust grievance mechanisms\n- National social registries built for one programme can serve as platforms for multiple interventions, including emergency response\n- Transfer values must be indexed to inflation to maintain real purchasing power, particularly in volatile macroeconomic environments\n- Conditional cash transfers require adequate supply-side investment in health and education services to generate human capital gains\n- Political will for social protection can emerge from the need to manage the political costs of austerity\n\n## References\n\n1.
