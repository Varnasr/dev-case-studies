  "content": "## Background\n\nDespite decades of anti-poverty programming, the extreme poor, those living on less than $1.25 per day, remained largely excluded from mainstream development interventions. Microfinance programs typically bypassed the ultra-poor, who were considered too risky or too consumption-constrained to repay loans. Social safety nets provided temporary consumption support but did not build productive capacity. Training programs assumed baseline assets and literacy that the extreme poor lacked.\n\nBRAC, the world's largest NGO, recognized this gap through its own experience. Founded by Fazle Hasan Abed in 1972 in Bangladesh, BRAC had become a leader in microfinance, education, and health. Yet its staff observed that the poorest communities, particularly women heading households without assets, skills, or social networks, were not benefiting from BRAC's existing programs. These households were trapped in extreme poverty, unable to access even the first rung of the economic ladder.\n\nThe challenge was to design an intervention comprehensive enough to address the multiple, interlocking constraints facing the ultra-poor: no assets, no skills, poor health, social marginalization, and psychological despair.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nBRAC launched its Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program in 2002, later known as the \"Graduation Approach\" as it was adopted globally. The program provides a carefully sequenced, time-limited package of support designed to help the extreme poor \"graduate\" to sustainable livelihoods within approximately 24 months.\n\nThe core components include: (1) a productive asset transfer (typically livestock such as cows, goats, or poultry, or inputs for small trade, worth approximately $100–$500); (2) skills training in managing the asset and running a microenterprise; (3) regular coaching visits from a dedicated mentor (weekly or biweekly for 18–24 months); (4) consumption support (small stipend or food transfer during the initial period to prevent participants from consuming or selling the asset); (5) access to savings services; and (6) health education and access to basic healthcare.\n\nThe theory of change is that the extreme poor face multiple binding constraints simultaneously. Providing only one component (e.g., just an asset, or just training) is insufficient because other constraints prevent productive use of that single input. The comprehensive package addresses all major constraints within a defined timeframe, building momentum toward a tipping point from which households can sustain themselves.\n\nCGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor), a World Bank-housed partnership, adopted the Graduation Approach in 2006 and partnered with the Ford Foundation to support pilots in eight countries. This collaboration was instrumental in generating the rigorous evidence that would drive global adoption.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBanerjee, Duflo, Goldberg, Karlan, Osei, Pariente, Shapiro, Thuysbaert, and Udry (2015), published in *Science*, presented results from six randomized controlled trials of the Graduation Approach in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru. The landmark study found remarkably consistent positive effects across all six sites: participants experienced significant increases in consumption (estimated at 5–10%), food security, assets, and savings. Critically, these gains were sustained at least one year after the program ended (three years from baseline), providing evidence that the intervention produced lasting rather than temporary improvements.\n\nThe consistency of results across diverse contexts was striking. Despite differences in culture, economic structure, implementing organizations, and the specific assets transferred, the program produced positive outcomes everywhere it was tested. This addressed the external validity concerns that often limit the generalizability of development RCTs.\n\nBanerjee, Duflo, and Sharma (2021) published a seven-year follow-up of the India component (implemented by Bandhan) in the *American Economic Review*. They found that gains in consumption, income, food security, and asset holdings persisted seven years after the asset transfer, providing the strongest evidence to date that the Graduation Approach produces lasting poverty reduction rather than temporary effects that fade.\n\nIn Bangladesh, BRAC's own evaluations showed that 95% of TUP participants had \"graduated\" from extreme poverty within two years, maintaining diversified income sources and increased consumption. By 2023, BRAC had reached over 2 million ultra-poor households through TUP in Bangladesh.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCost is a primary concern. At approximately $530 per beneficiary in the original BRAC model (and higher in some international adaptations), the Graduation Approach is substantially more expensive than unconditional cash transfers or basic social protection programs. Cost-effectiveness comparisons depend on assumptions about the duration of benefits: if gains persist indefinitely, the present-value cost-effectiveness is favorable; if they eventually fade, the calculus changes.\n\nScalability through government systems raises challenges. The intensive coaching component, which many evaluators identify as crucial to the program's success, requires trained, motivated staff with low caseloads. Government social protection systems may struggle to deliver this quality of personalized support at national scale.\n\nThe approach works best for the productive poor, those who are extremely poor but physically capable of managing assets and building microenterprises. It may be less appropriate for the elderly, disabled, or chronically ill, who require ongoing social protection rather than time-limited livelihood support.\n\nQuestions remain about the mechanisms driving impact. Is the asset transfer the critical component, or is it the coaching, the consumption support, or the combination? Component-disaggregation studies have produced mixed results, though the consensus is that the comprehensive package outperforms any single component.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- The extreme poor face multiple binding constraints that require comprehensive, integrated interventions rather than single-component programs\n- Time-limited intensive support can produce sustained poverty reduction if it helps households cross a threshold of productive capacity\n- Evidence from multi-country RCTs with consistent results provides unusually strong support for external validity\n- Coaching and mentoring components may be as important as material transfers for building confidence, skills, and behavioral change\n- Cost-effectiveness depends critically on the duration of benefits, making long-term follow-up studies essential for policy decisions\n\n## References\n\n1.
