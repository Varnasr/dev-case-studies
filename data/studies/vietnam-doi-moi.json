  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Vietnam's economy was in crisis. A decade after reunification in 1975, the attempt to impose central planning on the south had failed. Annual inflation exceeded 700% in 1986. Agricultural collectivization had depressed production, making the country dependent on Soviet food aid. Per capita income was approximately $100, placing Vietnam among the world's poorest nations. The Soviet Union, Vietnam's primary patron, was itself entering a period of economic decline under Gorbachev, reducing the subsidies that sustained Vietnam's economy.\n\nThe crisis was not merely economic but existential for the Communist Party of Vietnam. Widespread food shortages, particularly in the north, and the evident prosperity of informal market activities in the south undermined the legitimacy of central planning. Local officials in provinces like Long An and Vinh Phu had already begun unauthorized experiments with household-based farming and market pricing, creating de facto reform from below.\n\nAt the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party in December 1986, the leadership formally adopted Doi Moi (\"renovation\"), a comprehensive program of economic reform. General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh, who had witnessed the vitality of southern market practices, championed the reforms. As Fforde and de Vylder (1996) documented, Doi Moi represented the formalization of changes already underway rather than a top-down policy revolution.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nDoi Moi proceeded along several interconnected dimensions. In agriculture, the system of collective farming was dismantled through Resolution 10 (1988), which allocated land use rights to individual households on long-term leases and allowed farmers to sell surplus production at market prices. This single reform transformed Vietnam's food security: within three years, Vietnam shifted from a net rice importer to the world's second-largest rice exporter.\n\nIn industry and trade, the reforms progressively liberalized prices, reduced subsidies to state-owned enterprises, legalized private enterprise, and opened the economy to foreign direct investment. The 1987 Foreign Investment Law was among the most liberal in the socialist world, offering tax incentives and profit repatriation guarantees to foreign investors. Bilateral trade agreements, culminating in WTO accession in 2007, integrated Vietnam into global supply chains.\n\nMacroeconomic stabilization was achieved through tight fiscal and monetary policies in the early 1990s, bringing inflation from triple digits to single digits. The dong was unified and devalued to competitive levels. Banking reform was initiated, though it remained incomplete, with state-owned banks continuing to dominate the financial system and direct credit to state enterprises.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe economic results were transformative. GDP growth averaged 6.5% annually from 1990 to 2020, making Vietnam one of the fastest-growing economies globally over this period. GDP per capita rose from approximately $100 in 1986 to $3,756 by 2022. The poverty rate, measured at $1.90 per day purchasing power parity, fell from 58% in 1993 to under 2% by 2020. Vietnam achieved lower-middle-income country status in 2010.\n\nTrade integration has been remarkable. Vietnam's trade-to-GDP ratio exceeded 185% by 2022, among the highest in the world for an economy of its size. FDI registered capital reached $22.4 billion in 2022, with major investments from South Korea, Japan, Singapore, and increasingly from companies diversifying supply chains from China. Manufacturing exports grew to over $336 billion in 2022, driven by electronics (Samsung alone accounts for roughly one-fifth of Vietnam's total exports), textiles, and footwear.\n\nThe World Bank and other international institutions have frequently cited Vietnam as a development success story. Poverty reduction was broad-based, with improvements across all regions and ethnic groups, though significant disparities persist between the Kinh majority and ethnic minorities, and between urban and rural areas.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nState-owned enterprise (SOE) reform remains Vietnam's most significant unfinished agenda. SOEs continue to consume a disproportionate share of credit and investment while generating lower returns than the private sector. Equitization (partial privatization) has proceeded slowly, and the state retains controlling stakes in most large enterprises. The Vinashin (shipbuilding) debt scandal in 2010, involving losses of over $4 billion, highlighted the risks of unreformed state enterprises.\n\nEnvironmental degradation has accompanied rapid industrialization, with severe air and water pollution in industrial zones and major cities. Governance challenges persist: corruption remains pervasive according to Transparency International rankings, the legal system lacks independence, and civil society organizations face significant constraints. The single-party system limits accountability mechanisms that might address these challenges, though the Party's pragmatic orientation has generally prioritized economic performance.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Formalizing and scaling successful local experiments can be more effective than imposing top-down reform blueprints, as Vietnam's gradualist approach demonstrated.\n- Agricultural liberalization can yield rapid, broad-based poverty reduction by raising incomes for the rural majority.\n- Trade integration and FDI liberalization can accelerate industrialization, but require complementary investments in infrastructure, education, and institutional capacity.\n- SOE reform is politically difficult but economically essential; incomplete reform creates fiscal risks and misallocation of capital.\n- Gradual economic reform within a single-party system can achieve growth but faces inherent limitations in accountability and governance.\n\n## References\n\n- Fforde, A., & de Vylder, S.
