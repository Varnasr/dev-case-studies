  "content": "## Background\n\nThe ejido land system was one of the defining legacies of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920). Enshrined in Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution, it mandated redistribution of large landholdings (latifundios) to landless peasants in the form of communal ejidos. Under the ejido system, land was owned collectively by the community, with individual members (ejidatarios) receiving usufruct rights to specific parcels. Critically, ejido land could not be sold, rented, or used as collateral — provisions intended to prevent reconcentration of land.\n\nBy the late 20th century, approximately 28,000 ejidos encompassed over half of Mexico's agricultural land and supported 3.5 million families. However, the restrictions on land transactions were increasingly seen as obstacles to agricultural modernization. Ejidatarios could not access formal credit (as land could not serve as collateral), could not legally adjust holdings to efficient scale, and faced investment disincentives due to insecure and informal tenure arrangements.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nIn 1992, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari pushed through a constitutional amendment to Article 27, fundamentally altering the ejido framework as part of broader neoliberal reforms and preparation for NAFTA. The reform ended the government's obligation to distribute land, permitted ejidatarios to sell, rent, or mortgage their parcels (after community approval), and allowed ejidos to convert to full private property through a dominio pleno process.\n\nTo implement these reforms, the government launched PROCEDE (Programa de Certificación de Derechos Ejidales y Titulación de Solares Urbanos) in 1993. This massive land certification program used satellite imagery, geographic information systems, and community assemblies to demarcate, survey, and certify individual parcels and common lands within ejidos. Each ejidatario received a certificate specifying their individual parcel boundaries and rights.\n\nPROCEDE was implemented on a voluntary basis, requiring approval by the ejido assembly. Remarkably, the program achieved near-universal coverage: by its conclusion in 2006, approximately 92% of ejidos had been certified, covering 3.5 million parcels and 85 million hectares. The successor program FANAR continued certifying remaining communities.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nDe Janvry, Emerick, Gonzalez-Navarro, and Sadoulet (2015) published in the American Economic Review found that PROCEDE certification had modest but positive effects on agricultural productivity, primarily through enabling more efficient land allocation via rental markets. Certified ejidatarios were more likely to participate in off-farm labor markets, as formal certificates reduced the need for physical presence to protect land claims.\n\nWarman (2001) in *El Campo Mexicano en el Siglo XX* provided historical context showing that the ejido system, while protecting peasant land access, had contributed to minifundismo (fragmentation into uneconomically small plots) and limited agricultural investment over decades. The reform represented an attempt to address these structural constraints.\n\nHowever, the land market liberalization that reformers anticipated largely did not materialize. De Janvry et al. (2014) found that fewer than 5% of titled parcels had been sold by 2007, and conversion to dominio pleno was rare. Communal norms, social ties, and the symbolic importance of ejido membership restrained market transactions. Credit access also did not significantly increase, as commercial banks remained reluctant to lend against ejido land due to enforcement uncertainties and small parcel sizes.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCritics of the 1992 reform argued it represented a dismantling of revolutionary social commitments. Bartra (1993) warned that land market liberalization would lead to dispossession of vulnerable ejidatarios. While mass land sales did not occur, evidence suggests some concentration in areas near urban expansion zones, where land values incentivized sales.\n\nThe reform coincided with the NAFTA-driven liberalization of agricultural markets, which exposed Mexican smallholders to competition from highly subsidized U.S. agriculture. Corn prices fell significantly, undermining ejidatario livelihoods. The combination of land reform and trade liberalization contributed to increased rural migration to the United States during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nGender equity was a significant gap. Despite women constituting a substantial share of the agricultural labor force, they represented only about 20% of ejido certificate holders, as historical registration had favored male household heads. The reform did not adequately address this structural gender disparity in land rights.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Land titling alone is insufficient to stimulate investment and market development; complementary reforms in credit markets, infrastructure, and agricultural support are essential\n- Communal land institutions have social and cultural functions beyond economic efficiency, and communities may rationally resist market-oriented reforms\n- Large-scale certification programs are technically feasible and can achieve near-universal coverage when implemented through participatory community processes\n- Land reforms should explicitly address gender disparities in tenure rights to avoid entrenching historical inequalities\n- Simultaneous trade liberalization can undermine the intended benefits of land reform for smallholder farmers\n\n## References\n\n1. de Janvry, A., Emerick, K., Gonzalez-Navarro, M., & Sadoulet, E.
