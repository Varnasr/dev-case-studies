  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the turn of the millennium, three infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, were devastating the developing world. HIV/AIDS was killing 3 million people annually, with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing 70% of the global burden. Tuberculosis claimed 1.7 million lives per year, increasingly complicated by drug resistance and HIV co-infection. Malaria killed over one million people annually, predominantly children under five in Africa.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV existed but cost $10,000–15,000 per patient per year, placing it far beyond the reach of developing country health systems. Effective malaria prevention through insecticide-treated bed nets cost only $5–10 per net but remained unavailable to hundreds of millions at risk. The international community recognized that existing funding mechanisms were grossly inadequate to address these converging epidemics.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was established in January 2002, following a call by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the 2001 G8 Summit and the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS. It was designed as an innovative financing mechanism rather than an implementing agency, channeling resources to countries while leaving program design and execution to national governments and local partners.\n\nThe Global Fund introduced several governance innovations. Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCMs) brought together government, civil society, the private sector, and affected communities to develop and oversee grant proposals. This multi-stakeholder model was intended to ensure inclusive decision-making and accountability.\n\nPerformance-based funding became a defining feature. Grants were structured with clear targets and disbursements were linked to demonstrated results. An independent technical review panel assessed proposals based on technical merit, and the Office of the Inspector General provided oversight. Countries that failed to meet targets faced funding reductions or grant termination.\n\nThe fund's impact on ART scale-up was transformative. Generic competition and bulk procurement through mechanisms like the Medicines Patent Pool drove ART costs below $100 per patient per year, enabling massive treatment expansion. By 2023, the Global Fund supported 24.5 million people on antiretroviral treatment.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe Global Fund's results have been extensively evaluated. Fan et al. (2012) found that Global Fund investments in malaria control were associated with significant reductions in all-cause child mortality in recipient countries. Their analysis, published in *PLOS Medicine*, estimated that the fund's malaria grants averted approximately 1.1 million deaths in Africa between 2002 and 2012.\n\nMacro International evaluations of the Global Fund's country-level programs documented substantial scale-up of key interventions. HIV testing and counseling expanded from near-zero in many African countries to millions of tests annually. The distribution of insecticide-treated nets increased from 30 million in 2004 to over 280 million annually by 2020, contributing to a roughly 50% reduction in malaria mortality across Africa.\n\nThe fund's performance-based model has been credited with improving accountability and results orientation in global health financing. An independent evaluation by the Euro Health Group (2017) found that the funding model effectively channeled resources to high-burden countries and catalyzed domestic resource mobilization.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Global Fund has faced significant challenges. Corruption and misuse of funds in several countries, including Mali, Mauritania, Zambia, and Djibouti, led to grant suspensions and reputational damage. The Inspector General's investigations revealed systemic weaknesses in financial oversight, prompting reforms to strengthen fiduciary controls.\n\nThe CCM model, while innovative, has been criticized for being complex and sometimes dominated by government actors at the expense of civil society participation. In countries with weak governance, the model's effectiveness depends heavily on the independence and capacity of local stakeholders.\n\nSustainability remains a central concern. Many recipient countries have been slow to increase domestic health spending, creating dependency on external funding. The transition from Global Fund support to domestic financing has proven difficult, particularly in lower-middle-income countries approaching graduation thresholds.\n\nCritics have also raised concerns about vertical funding silos. The disease-specific focus, while enabling targeted results, may have drawn resources and health workers away from broader health system strengthening.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Performance-based funding can drive results and accountability in global health, but requires robust monitoring and oversight\n- Multi-stakeholder governance (CCMs) promotes inclusive decision-making but adds complexity and requires strong civil society capacity\n- Massive scale-up of treatment is possible when financing is combined with market-shaping interventions to reduce commodity costs\n- Anti-corruption safeguards must be built into financing mechanisms from the outset\n- Sustainability planning and domestic resource mobilization must be prioritized alongside immediate program delivery\n\n## References\n\n1.
