  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the early 1970s, South Korea had achieved a decade of remarkable export-led growth based on labor-intensive light manufacturing, particularly textiles, wigs, plywood, and processed food. However, the model faced structural limits. Wages were rising, eroding competitiveness in low-end manufacturing. Competition from other developing countries intensified. Most critically, President Park Chung-hee faced a strategic security shock: the Nixon Doctrine of 1969 signaled reduced US military commitment in Asia, and the planned withdrawal of one-third of US forces from Korea in 1971 created an imperative for indigenous defense industrial capacity.\n\nThe global economic environment added urgency. The 1973 oil crisis revealed Korea's extreme dependence on imported energy and raw materials. Park and his economic advisors, particularly the influential Blue House Senior Secretary for Economic Affairs Oh Won-chol, concluded that Korea must develop heavy and chemical industries to provide inputs for defense production, reduce import dependence, and move to higher-value-added exports.\n\nThe intellectual foundations drew on the Japanese developmental state model and the analysis of economic planners who argued that comparative advantage could be created through deliberate state intervention rather than passively following existing factor endowments. As Amsden (1989) argued in her seminal work \"Asia's Next Giant,\" Korea's industrialization represented a case of \"getting prices wrong\" deliberately to achieve dynamic efficiency.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Heavy and Chemical Industry (HCI) drive was formally launched in January 1973 with President Park's declaration that Korea would build a self-reliant economy based on heavy and chemical industries. The plan designated six strategic sectors: steel, shipbuilding, machinery, electronics, petrochemicals, and nonferrous metals. The government created dedicated industrial estates, including the massive Changwon complex for machinery and the Yeocheon petrochemical complex.\n\nFinancing was directed through the National Investment Fund, which channeled household savings, pension funds, and foreign borrowings to HCI projects at subsidized interest rates. Policy loans for HCI sectors carried interest rates of 8-12%, compared to 15-20% for other sectors, representing a substantial subsidy. The tax system provided accelerated depreciation, investment tax credits, and tariff exemptions for imported capital equipment.\n\nPOSCO (Pohang Iron and Steel Company), established in 1968 with Japanese reparation funds and technical assistance, exemplified the HCI model. Despite World Bank skepticism that Korea lacked the prerequisites for integrated steelmaking, POSCO's Pohang works became operational in 1973, expanding through four phases to reach 8.6 million tons of crude steel capacity by 1981. Lane (2022), in a comprehensive reappraisal, documented how POSCO achieved international competitiveness within a decade through a combination of imported technology, intensive worker training, and relentless cost reduction.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe HCI drive fundamentally transformed South Korea's industrial structure. The share of heavy and chemical industries in total manufacturing output rose from approximately 38% in 1972 to over 50% by 1980. HCI products grew from roughly 21% of total exports in 1972 to approximately 45% by 1980. Korea established globally competitive positions in steel (POSCO), shipbuilding (Hyundai Heavy Industries became the world's largest shipbuilder), and laid the foundations for later dominance in automobiles and electronics.\n\nAmsden (1989) argued that the HCI drive demonstrated the potential of late industrialization through deliberate state intervention, using subsidies to create comparative advantage in sectors where market forces alone would not have directed investment. Lane (2022) showed that the long-term returns on HCI investments, particularly in steel and shipbuilding, substantially exceeded the costs, vindicating the policy despite short-term distortions.\n\nHowever, the HCI drive also generated significant macroeconomic problems. The massive investment program contributed to inflationary pressures, with consumer price inflation exceeding 20% annually in the late 1970s. Overcapacity emerged in several sectors, as multiple chaebols invested in the same industries simultaneously. The real estate market overheated as investment was concentrated in specific locations. These imbalances contributed to the economic crisis of 1979-1980, which coincided with Park's assassination.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCritiques of the HCI drive center on its costs and distortions. The massive directed credit to HCI sectors starved light manufacturing and small businesses of capital, contributing to industrial concentration and the dominance of chaebols. The 1979-1980 crisis required a painful adjustment period, with the subsequent Chun Doo-hwan government implementing stabilization measures and rationalizing overcapacity through forced mergers.\n\nSome economists, including Yoo (1990), argued that Korea's growth was driven primarily by factor accumulation (labor and capital inputs) rather than the efficiency gains claimed by industrial policy advocates, and that the HCI drive misallocated resources compared to what market mechanisms would have achieved. The debate remains unresolved, though the long-term success of HCI-targeted sectors has strengthened the case for selective industrial policy.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Strategic industrial policy can create comparative advantage in heavy industries, but requires sustained commitment, substantial financing, and tolerance of short-term economic distortions.\n- Security imperatives can provide compelling political rationale for industrial policy that pure economic arguments may not generate.\n- Financing mechanisms that channel subsidized credit to priority sectors are effective but create risks of overcapacity, inflation, and crowding out of non-targeted sectors.\n- The success of industrial policy depends critically on imposing performance discipline on recipient firms, including export targets and efficiency requirements.\n- Long-term evaluation of industrial policy may yield different conclusions than short-term assessment, as the full returns on heavy industry investments take decades to materialize.\n\n## References\n\n- Amsden, A.
