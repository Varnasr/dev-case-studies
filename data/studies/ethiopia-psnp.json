  "content": "## Background\n\nEthiopia's history of famine and chronic food insecurity made it one of the largest recipients of emergency food aid in the world. Between 1994 and 2004, an average of 5-6 million people required emergency food assistance annually, with numbers spiking to over 14 million during severe droughts. The emergency response system was characterized by repeated cycles: drought hit, crops failed, a humanitarian appeal was launched, food aid arrived months later, and the cycle repeated. This approach was widely recognized as inefficient, undignified, and insufficient to prevent household asset depletion.\n\nBy the early 2000s, a consensus emerged among the Ethiopian government, the World Bank, and major donors (USAID, DFID, the European Commission, and others) that a predictable safety net could replace much of the emergency system. The key insight was that a large proportion of food aid recipients were the same households year after year—chronically food-insecure rather than temporarily affected. Providing them with predictable, timely transfers could break the cycle of asset depletion and enable accumulation.\n\nThe design drew on international evidence from safety net programs, particularly from India's Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme and Latin American conditional cash transfer programs. A coalition of donors agreed to pool resources and provide multi-year predictable funding, addressing one of the core problems of the emergency system: annual unpredictable appeals.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) launched in January 2005 as a joint initiative of the Government of Ethiopia and a consortium of donors. It initially covered approximately 5 million people in 192 food-insecure woredas (districts) in four major regions: Amhara, Oromia, Southern Nations, and Tigray. The program had two components: public works (approximately 80% of beneficiaries) and direct support (approximately 20%).\n\nPublic works participants contributed labor—typically 5 days per month for 6 months during the agricultural lean season—to community-identified infrastructure projects including soil and water conservation terraces, road construction, school building, and reforestation. In return, they received either food (15 kg of grain per person per month) or an equivalent cash payment. Direct support provided unconditional transfers to labor-poor households: the elderly, disabled, chronically ill, and pregnant or lactating women.\n\nA linked program, the Household Asset Building Programme (HABP, later the Livelihoods component), provided complementary services including agricultural extension, credit, and technology packages intended to enable households to \"graduate\" from the safety net by achieving food security. Graduation criteria were defined as the point at which a household could meet its food needs for 12 months and withstand modest shocks without external assistance.\n\nThe program evolved through multiple phases, expanding to 8 million beneficiaries by Phase IV (2015-2020) and incorporating an integrated risk financing mechanism to provide additional support during acute shocks, partly addressing the ongoing need for emergency responses beyond the regular caseload.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBerhane et al. (2014), in a comprehensive impact evaluation for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), found that the PSNP significantly improved household food security. Beneficiary households experienced a reduction in the food gap (the number of months during which a household could not meet its food needs) of approximately 1.05 months compared to non-beneficiaries. The study also found that the program protected household assets, with beneficiaries less likely to sell livestock or other productive assets during lean periods.\n\nGilligan, Hoddinott, and Taffesse (2009), published in the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, evaluated the combined effect of PSNP and complementary livelihood programs. They found that households receiving both PSNP transfers and food security program support experienced significantly larger gains in food security and asset accumulation than those receiving PSNP alone. This evidence supported the program's integrated design rationale.\n\nThe World Bank's 2015 review documented that the program's public works component had created substantial community infrastructure: over 300,000 kilometers of soil and water conservation structures, thousands of kilometers of rural roads, and significant reforestation. However, the quality and maintenance of these assets varied considerably. Graduation rates were lower than initially hoped; by 2014, fewer than 1 million of the original 5 million beneficiaries had graduated, suggesting that the graduation targets were overly optimistic.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nTransfer adequacy was a persistent concern. The value of transfers—approximately $4-5 per person per month—was widely considered insufficient to meet household food needs, let alone enable asset accumulation. Coll-Black et al. (2013) documented that transfer values had eroded in real terms due to inflation, and delays in payments (sometimes arriving months late) undermined the predictability that was central to the program's design rationale.\n\nTargeting was politically contentious. Woreda-level allocation was determined by federal government criteria, but household-level selection was done by community food security task forces, which were susceptible to local power dynamics and political manipulation. Several studies documented inclusion and exclusion errors, with some non-poor connected households receiving benefits while some of the poorest were excluded. The PSNP also faced challenges during major shocks: during the 2015-2016 El Nino-induced drought, the program's contingency mechanisms proved insufficient, and an additional 10 million people required emergency assistance beyond the PSNP caseload. The ongoing civil conflict in Tigray from 2020 to 2022 severely disrupted program implementation in one of its core areas.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Predictable transfers are more effective than emergency aid**: Moving from unpredictable humanitarian appeals to regular, anticipated transfers reduced household distress and enabled forward planning.\n- **Public works can generate community assets but quality varies**: The dual benefit of providing income while building infrastructure is theoretically attractive, but the quality, relevance, and maintenance of public works assets require strong technical oversight.\n- **Graduation from safety nets is harder than assumed**: The expectation that households would rapidly achieve food security and exit the program was overly optimistic; chronic poverty requires sustained support and structural economic changes.\n- **Transfer adequacy must be maintained against inflation**: Programs must build in automatic indexation or regular adjustment mechanisms to prevent the real value of transfers from eroding over time.\n- **Integration with complementary programs amplifies impact**: The evidence that PSNP plus livelihoods support outperformed PSNP alone underscores the importance of combining social protection with productive interventions.\n\n## References\n\n- Berhane, G., Gilligan, D.O., Hoddinott, J., Kumar, N., and Taffesse, A.S.
