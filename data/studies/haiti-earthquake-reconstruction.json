  "content": "## Background\n\nOn January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, with its epicenter near the capital Port-au-Prince. The devastation was catastrophic: over 220,000 people killed (government estimates; some analyses suggest 46,000–85,000), 300,000 injured, and 1.5 million displaced. An estimated 300,000 homes and 30,000 commercial buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The economic loss was estimated at 120% of Haiti's GDP.\n\nHaiti's extreme vulnerability to the earthquake was a product of decades of political instability, institutional weakness, environmental degradation, and poverty. As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with GDP per capita of approximately US$660, Haiti lacked building codes enforcement, emergency response capacity, and the institutional infrastructure for reconstruction. The concentration of government, commerce, and population in Port-au-Prince amplified the catastrophe.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe international response was massive. Over US$13.5 billion was pledged by governments, international organizations, and private donors for relief and reconstruction. The United States alone committed over US$3.6 billion. Major humanitarian organizations—including the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières, USAID, and hundreds of NGOs—deployed to Haiti.\n\nThe Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), co-chaired by former US President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, was established to coordinate reconstruction. The IHRC was intended to prioritize projects, channel funding, and ensure alignment between donor priorities and Haitian needs.\n\nReconstruction plans focused on housing, infrastructure, government capacity building, and economic development. The \"Build Back Better\" concept was invoked, suggesting that reconstruction should address underlying vulnerabilities rather than simply restoring pre-earthquake conditions.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nKatz (2013), in his investigative book *The Big Truck That Went By*, documented systemic failures in the international aid response. He found that the majority of aid funding was channeled through international organizations and foreign contractors rather than Haitian institutions. An estimated 94 cents of every US dollar in US earthquake aid went to non-Haitian entities—US-based contractors, international NGOs, and multilateral organizations. This bypassing of local institutions further weakened Haitian government capacity.\n\nThe IHRC's mandate expired in October 2011 without renewal, having approved US$3.2 billion in projects but having achieved limited coordination of the fragmented aid landscape. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of USAID spending found significant delays, cost overruns, and questionable outcomes.\n\nFarmer (2011), the physician and anthropologist who had worked in Haiti for decades, argued that the reconstruction failure reflected deeper structural issues in international aid, including donor-driven priorities, short-term funding cycles, and the marginalization of Haitian agency. He advocated for channeling resources through Haitian institutions and investing in the country's public health and education systems.\n\nThe cholera epidemic, introduced by Nepalese UN peacekeepers whose sewage contaminated the Artibonit River, killed over 10,000 people and sickened hundreds of thousands. The UN initially denied responsibility for years before acknowledging its role in 2016. The epidemic demonstrated the risks of large-scale international military and humanitarian deployments in fragile settings.\n\nBy 2020, the housing situation had improved—most displaced persons had left camps—but many were in informal settlements with poor conditions. Only a fraction of planned permanent housing was built.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe aid coordination failure was profound. With over 10,000 NGOs operating in Haiti (earning it the nickname \"Republic of NGOs\"), fragmentation was extreme. Many organizations operated independently of Haitian government planning, pursuing their own priorities and reporting to their own donors rather than to national authorities.\n\nAccountability was severely lacking. ProPublica and NPR investigations revealed that the American Red Cross, which raised nearly US$500 million for Haiti, built only six permanent homes despite pledging to provide housing for 130,000 people. The organization's internal project management failures were documented in detail.\n\nThe \"Build Back Better\" vision largely failed to materialize. Reconstruction primarily restored pre-existing conditions rather than addressing the underlying vulnerabilities—unregulated construction, environmental degradation, concentrated urbanization—that had made the earthquake so devastating.\n\nHaitian political instability further complicated reconstruction, with contested elections, political crises, and ultimately the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Channeling aid through international organizations rather than local institutions can undermine state capacity and reconstruction sustainability\n- Coordination mechanisms like the IHRC require genuine authority, local ownership, and sustained mandates to be effective\n- Disaster reconstruction must address underlying vulnerabilities, not merely restore pre-disaster conditions\n- Accountability mechanisms for international aid are critically insufficient, allowing massive resource flows with minimal oversight\n- Large-scale international deployments carry their own risks, as demonstrated by the cholera epidemic\n\n## References\n\n1.
