  "content": "## Background\n\nRomania's transition from communism was among the most turbulent in Central and Eastern Europe. The violent overthrow of Ceausescu in December 1989 was followed by a contested transition led by former communists under Ion Iliescu. Economic reform was delayed compared to Poland and the Czech Republic, with meaningful privatization and market liberalization not accelerating until the late 1990s. By the early 2000s, Romania remained one of Europe's poorest countries, with GDP per capita roughly a quarter of the EU average.\n\nEU accession negotiations, formally opened in 2000, provided a powerful external anchor for reform. The prospect of membership incentivized — and in many areas required — institutional changes in judiciary, competition policy, public procurement, and market regulation. Romania joined the EU on January 1, 2007, alongside Bulgaria, though both countries were placed under a unique Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) to monitor continued progress in justice reform and anti-corruption.\n\nDaianu (2009) analyzed Romania's EU integration challenges, arguing that the country's institutional capacity lagged behind its formal commitments, creating implementation gaps that would persist well beyond accession.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nEU membership brought access to massive financial transfers through structural and cohesion funds. For the 2007-2013 programming period, Romania was allocated approximately EUR 19.7 billion, rising to approximately EUR 46 billion for the 2014-2020 period (including national co-financing). These funds targeted infrastructure (transport, environment, energy), human capital development, agricultural modernization, and regional development.\n\nThe programming framework required Romania to develop Operational Programmes specifying investment priorities, establish managing authorities to oversee implementation, and create monitoring and evaluation systems meeting EU standards. Technical assistance was provided through twinning programs with experienced EU member state administrations.\n\nBeyond financial transfers, the EU accession framework required Romania to transpose and implement the entire acquis communautaire — tens of thousands of pages of EU law covering everything from food safety to environmental protection. The CVM imposed additional reporting requirements on judicial independence and anti-corruption, with annual European Commission assessments.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nRomania's economic convergence with the EU average has been significant. GDP per capita in purchasing power parity terms rose from roughly 40% of the EU average at accession to approximately 77% by 2023 — one of the fastest convergence rates in the EU. Real GDP growth averaged approximately 4-5% annually in the pre-pandemic period (excluding the 2009 crisis), driven by EU-funded investment, rising wages, exports, and domestic consumption.\n\nHowever, fund absorption was persistently problematic. For the 2007-2013 programming period, Romania's absorption rate was among the lowest in the EU at approximately 75% by the end of the eligibility period — meaning billions of euros in available funding were left unspent. For the 2014-2020 period, absorption improved to roughly 60% by the end of the standard implementation window, but still lagged behind more experienced member states.\n\nThe infrastructure gap illustrated both the need and the difficulty. Romania entered the EU with approximately 200 kilometers of motorway — grossly inadequate for a country of 19 million people and 238,000 square kilometers. By 2023, the motorway network had grown to approximately 1,000 kilometers, but this remained far below planned targets and peer country levels. Major transport projects (particularly motorway and railway corridors) suffered chronic delays due to procurement problems, land acquisition disputes, poor contractor performance, and administrative bottlenecks.\n\nThe World Bank's convergence analysis noted that Romania's growth was increasingly driven by consumption and wage increases rather than productivity gains, raising sustainability concerns. The IT sector emerged as a notable success story, benefiting from strong technical education traditions and competitive wages.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nCorruption in public procurement remained a persistent problem. The National Anti-Corruption Directorate (DNA) prosecuted numerous cases involving EU fund fraud, including manipulation of tender specifications, conflict of interest, and falsified documentation. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) conducted multiple investigations. These cases demonstrated both the scale of the problem and the functionality of anti-corruption institutions.\n\nRegional inequality widened despite cohesion funds designed to reduce it. Bucharest and western Romania (closer to EU markets) grew rapidly, while the northeast and south remained among the poorest regions in the EU. Rural-urban disparities were stark, with rural areas suffering from depopulation, poor infrastructure, and limited access to public services.\n\nThe CVM, intended as a temporary post-accession mechanism, lasted 16 years (2007-2023), reflecting slow progress in judicial reform and anti-corruption. Political interference with anti-corruption institutions — particularly during the 2017-2019 period when the PSD government attempted to weaken corruption laws through emergency ordinances (triggering massive street protests) — demonstrated the fragility of reform gains.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- EU fund absorption requires institutional capacity that cannot be created overnight; administrative reform must precede or accompany increased funding availability\n- Infrastructure investment faces compound challenges in weak institutional environments: procurement corruption, land acquisition failures, and contractor capacity constraints interact to cause delays\n- Economic convergence can occur rapidly with EU integration but may be unevenly distributed geographically and socially without deliberate redistribution mechanisms\n- Anti-corruption institutions need sustained political protection; periodic attempts to weaken them are predictable and require robust civil society and EU-level safeguards\n- The CVM model of post-accession monitoring has limited enforcement power; conditionality is most effective before accession when the membership prospect is still at stake\n\n## References\n\n1.
