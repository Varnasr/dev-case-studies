  "content": "## Background\n\nMorocco imports approximately 94% of its energy needs, making it one of the most energy-dependent countries in the Middle East and North Africa. With no significant oil or gas reserves, the country relied heavily on imported fossil fuels, exposing its economy to commodity price volatility and creating a persistent trade deficit. By the late 2000s, energy imports consumed roughly 10% of GDP.\n\nHowever, Morocco possesses exceptional solar resources, with over 3,000 hours of sunshine annually and direct normal irradiance (DNI) among the highest in the world, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. King Mohammed VI launched the Moroccan Solar Plan (Plan Solaire Marocain) in 2009, setting an ambitious target of 2,000 MW of solar capacity by 2020. The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN, originally the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy) was established as the dedicated implementing body.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Noor-Ouarzazate complex, situated near the city of Ouarzazate at the edge of the Sahara Desert, was designed as a multi-phase project combining concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) technologies. The site selection leveraged exceptional solar irradiance (over 2,500 kWh/m2/year DNI) and proximity to existing transmission infrastructure.\n\nNoor I (160 MW), commissioned in 2016, uses parabolic trough CSP technology with three hours of thermal energy storage, allowing electricity generation after sunset. Noor II (200 MW) also employs parabolic trough technology with extended storage. Noor III (150 MW), commissioned in 2018, is a solar power tower with a central receiver and molten salt storage providing 7.5 hours of dispatch capacity. Noor IV (72 MW) uses photovoltaic technology.\n\nThe total investment of approximately $3.6 billion was financed through a complex multi-donor structure. The World Bank provided approximately $1.15 billion through the Clean Technology Fund and IBRD loans. The African Development Bank, European Investment Bank, Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), and KfW (Germany) contributed additional financing. MASEN structured the projects as public-private partnerships (PPPs), with ACWA Power (Saudi Arabia) and Sener (Spain) as lead developers for different phases.\n\nMASSEN's institutional model was innovative: it served as both regulator and off-taker, purchasing electricity from the PPP operators at negotiated tariffs and selling to the national utility (ONEE) at regulated rates, with the difference subsidized.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe complex has operated since 2016 and demonstrated that large-scale CSP with storage is technically viable in the MENA region. The thermal storage capability allows Noor I and Noor III to generate electricity for several hours after sunset, addressing the intermittency challenge of solar energy. Morocco's renewable energy capacity grew significantly, reaching approximately 37% of installed capacity by 2020.\n\nThe project avoids approximately 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually and reduces Morocco's fossil fuel import dependency. Morocco leveraged the project to position itself as a climate leader among developing countries, hosting COP22 in Marrakech in 2016 and submitting an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement.\n\nLocal economic benefits included approximately 2,000 construction jobs at peak and several hundred permanent positions. A local content strategy required sourcing of materials and services from Moroccan firms, and a training programme developed technical skills in the Ouarzazate region. The project catalyzed broader infrastructure development in the area, including road improvements and grid expansion.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe primary criticism concerns cost. CSP technology is significantly more expensive than photovoltaic solar, and the Noor complex electricity costs ($0.14-0.19/kWh for early phases) were well above global PV benchmark prices that had fallen below $0.03/kWh by 2020. Critics, including energy economists, argued that Morocco would have achieved more clean energy capacity per dollar invested with PV technology. The tariff differential is subsidized by the Moroccan state, creating a fiscal burden.\n\nThe technology choice was partly strategic: CSP with storage offered dispatchability that PV alone could not provide, and Morocco sought to develop domestic industrial capacity in CSP. However, the rapid decline in battery storage costs has weakened the cost advantage of thermal storage.\n\nWater consumption is another concern. CSP parabolic trough plants require significant water for cooling, a challenge in the arid Ouarzazate region. Noor III's tower technology uses dry cooling, partially addressing this issue but at higher cost.\n\nLand use and displacement of pastoral communities have drawn criticism, though MASEN implemented a resettlement and livelihood restoration plan. The benefits of the project have been concentrated in the energy sector rather than producing broader economic transformation in the surrounding region.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Dedicated institutional vehicles (MASEN) can accelerate renewable energy deployment by concentrating expertise and streamlining PPP procurement\n- CSP with thermal storage addresses intermittency but at significantly higher costs than PV, requiring ongoing evaluation as battery technology advances\n- Multi-donor financing structures enable large-scale investments but add complexity and transaction costs\n- Energy security concerns can justify technology choices that are not lowest-cost if they reduce import dependency and develop domestic industrial capacity\n- Large-scale renewable projects require water management strategies in arid environments\n- Climate diplomacy benefits (COP hosting, international leadership) can complement domestic energy policy objectives\n\n## References\n\n1.
