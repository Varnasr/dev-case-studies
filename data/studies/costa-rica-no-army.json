  "content": "## Background\n\nCosta Rica's decision to abolish its military emerged from the aftermath of the 1948 civil war, a 44-day conflict sparked by disputed election results. José Figueres Ferrer led an uprising against the government of Teodoro Picado, who had annulled the presidential election won by Otilio Ulate Blanco. After prevailing in the conflict, Figueres headed an 18-month governing junta that implemented sweeping reforms.\n\nOn December 1, 1948, Figueres declared the dissolution of the Costa Rican armed forces at a ceremony at the Cuartel Bellavista in San José. The 1949 Constitution, drafted under the junta, formally prohibited the establishment of a permanent military, stating in Article 12 that \"the Army as a permanent institution is proscribed.\" Costa Rica retained civil police and border security forces but eliminated the institutional structures of a standing military.\n\nThis decision was extraordinary in a region plagued by military coups, dictatorships, and civil wars throughout the twentieth century. While neighboring countries in Central America spent decades embroiled in armed conflict, Costa Rica pursued a markedly different development trajectory.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe abolition of the army freed substantial fiscal resources for social investment. Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, Costa Rica consistently allocated 6–8% of GDP to education and similarly high shares to healthcare. The Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS), established in 1941 but dramatically expanded after 1948, evolved into a near-universal healthcare system covering approximately 95% of the population.\n\nThe education system was expanded to provide free, compulsory education through secondary school. Public universities were established and heavily subsidized. Costa Rica became one of the first developing countries to achieve near-universal primary enrollment, and by the 1980s, secondary enrollment rates far exceeded regional averages.\n\nHealthcare investments focused on primary care and preventive medicine. A network of EBAIS (Equipos Básicos de Atención Integral en Salud) primary care teams was deployed across the country, ensuring rural and remote populations had access to basic health services. Vaccination coverage reached near-universal levels.\n\nThe political stability afforded by the absence of military threats to civilian governance also proved crucial. While Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua experienced military coups and civil wars from the 1960s through the 1990s, Costa Rica maintained uninterrupted democratic governance.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBooth (1998) documented how the absence of a military fundamentally shaped Costa Rica's political economy, reducing the power of authoritarian forces and enabling sustained democratic consolidation. The country has held free elections without interruption since 1949, making it one of the oldest democracies in Latin America.\n\nThe human development outcomes are striking. Life expectancy reached 80.3 years by 2020, comparable to the United States (78.8 years) despite GDP per capita being roughly one-fifth as high. Infant mortality fell to 7.8 per 1,000 live births. The literacy rate of 97.8% is among the highest in the Americas. Costa Rica's Human Development Index of 0.809 places it in the \"very high\" category.\n\nSandbrook et al. (2007), in their comparative study of social democratic development, identified Costa Rica as a paradigmatic case of a developing country achieving high human development through sustained social investment rather than rapid GDP growth. They emphasized the importance of the military's absence in enabling redistributive politics.\n\nEdgell et al. (2020) found that Costa Rica's democratic stability was significantly enhanced by demilitarization, which removed the primary instrument of authoritarian regression in Latin American politics. The absence of a military also meant that defense spending—which averaged 2–4% of GDP in neighboring countries—was available for productive investment.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite its achievements, the Costa Rican model faces significant challenges. Income inequality has risen since the 1990s, with the Gini coefficient reaching 0.49. Poverty rates have stagnated at approximately 20–21%, suggesting that the social investment model has not fully addressed structural inequality.\n\nSecurity concerns have grown as drug trafficking routes have shifted through Central America. Without a military, Costa Rica relies on police forces that are sometimes overwhelmed by organized crime. Homicide rates, while far below regional averages, have increased in recent decades.\n\nSome scholars argue that attributing Costa Rica's success primarily to military abolition oversimplifies a complex causal story. Factors including the country's relative ethnic homogeneity, coffee-based smallholder economy, early democratic traditions, and geographic position all contributed to its development trajectory.\n\nFiscal pressures have also strained the social investment model. The CCSS healthcare system faces financial deficits, and educational quality—as opposed to access—remains a concern.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Demilitarization can generate a substantial peace dividend when savings are systematically redirected to social sectors\n- Political stability and democratic consolidation are powerfully reinforced by the absence of a military capable of staging coups\n- Sustained social investment over decades can produce human development outcomes comparable to much wealthier countries\n- The model demonstrates that security can be maintained through civilian police forces without a standing military\n- High human development does not automatically resolve inequality—targeted anti-poverty policies remain necessary\n\n## References\n\n1.
