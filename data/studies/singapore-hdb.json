An estimated 1.3 million of the 1.9 million population lived in overcrowded shophouses, squatter settlements, and slums. The 1961 Bukit Ho Swee fire, which destroyed 2,800 homes and left 16,000 people homeless, dramatically underscored the urgency of the housing situation. Public housing was identified by the People's Action Party (PAP) government under Lee Kuan Yew as a top political and developmental priority.\n\nThe Housing and Development Board (HDB) was established in February 1960, replacing the colonial-era Singapore Improvement Trust, which had built only 23,000 units in 32 years. Under the leadership of Lim Kim San, the HDB embarked on an emergency building program of unprecedented scale and speed. In its first five years, the HDB built 54,000 units—more than double the SIT's entire output—housing over 400,000 people and largely solving the immediate squatter crisis.\n\nThe program required massive land acquisition, enabled by the Land Acquisition Act of 1966, which allowed the government to compulsorily acquire land at below-market prices for public purposes. By 1985, the state owned approximately 76% of Singapore's land area, giving the HDB the land bank needed for its building program. This land policy, while controversial for its impact on private landowners, was foundational to the program's success.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe HDB program evolved from emergency rental housing in the 1960s to a comprehensive home ownership model beginning in 1964, when the Home Ownership for the People Scheme was launched. The critical innovation came in 1968, when the government allowed citizens to use their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings—a mandatory pension contribution of up to 37% of wages (shared between employer and employee)—to finance the purchase of HDB flats. This linked the retirement savings system to housing, enabling mass homeownership without requiring households to save separately for down payments and mortgage servicing.\n\nPhang (2007) analyzed the HDB model comprehensively, documenting how the integration of public housing, land policy, CPF financing, and urban planning created a coherent system unmatched anywhere in the world. HDB flats are sold on 99-year leaseholds at subsidized prices, with substantial grants for first-time buyers. The secondary resale market, permitted since 1971, allows owners to realize capital gains, and resale prices have generally appreciated over time, creating a significant asset base for Singaporean households.\n\nThe Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP), introduced in 1989, imposed block-level and neighborhood-level quotas to ensure that each HDB estate reflected Singapore's multiethnic composition (Chinese ~75%, Malay ~14%, Indian ~8%). The policy was a response to the re-emergence of ethnic enclaves and aimed to promote social cohesion. While controversial as a constraint on individual choice, the EIP has been credited with preventing the residential segregation patterns common in other multiethnic societies.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe transformation of Singapore's housing landscape is among the most remarkable development achievements of the 20th century. From the slum conditions of the 1960s, Singapore moved to a situation where over 80% of its resident population lives in HDB flats, with a homeownership rate of approximately 90%—one of the highest in the world. The quality of housing improved dramatically over decades, from basic 1–2 room flats to modern estates with 3–5 room flats featuring integrated amenities, town centers, parks, and public transport connections.\n\nThe asset appreciation effect has been significant. HDB flats purchased in the 1970s and 1980s at modest prices have appreciated substantially, creating paper wealth for homeowners. Phang (2007) documented how this appreciation generated a broad sense of stakeholding among Singaporeans, aligning citizens' interests with national economic performance and political stability—a deliberate political strategy by the PAP government. The phrase \"asset enhancement\" became a key political promise, with upgrading programs for older estates tied to electoral support.\n\nUrban planning integration has been a distinguishing feature. HDB new towns are comprehensive developments including schools, markets, hawker centers, clinics, commercial space, and public transport. The Master Plan coordinates housing development with transport infrastructure, employment centers, and green space. The result is one of the most livable high-density urban environments in the world, with Singapore consistently ranking among the top Asian cities in quality-of-life indices.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe 99-year leasehold model has generated growing concern as early HDB flats approach the middle of their lease terms. As remaining lease shortens, flat values decline—a reality that contradicts the expectation of perpetual asset appreciation that many Singaporeans had assumed. Flats with 50–60 years remaining lease are already selling at significant discounts. The government's Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS), announced in 2018, offers a potential path for older estates, but the details and fiscal implications remain uncertain.\n\nAffordability pressures have increased, particularly for younger Singaporeans. While new BTO (Build-To-Order) flats remain subsidized, waiting times of 3–5 years and rising resale prices have strained affordability for first-time buyers. The CPF-housing nexus, while enabling homeownership, has been criticized for depleting retirement savings—many Singaporeans reach retirement age with substantial housing assets but insufficient CPF savings for adequate retirement income. The system also creates rigidity, as housing wealth is illiquid and difficult to convert into retirement income without downsizing.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Comprehensive public housing programs can solve housing crises at scale, but require political will, institutional capacity, and enabling policies including land acquisition and long-term planning.\n- Linking mandatory savings (CPF) to housing finance enables mass homeownership without conventional mortgage markets, but creates trade-offs with retirement adequacy.\n- Ethnic integration policies in housing can effectively prevent residential segregation, though at the cost of constraining individual choice in housing markets.\n- Leasehold public housing creates long-term policy challenges as leases depreciate, requiring governments to manage expectations about perpetual asset appreciation.\n- Integrating housing with transport, employment, and social infrastructure through comprehensive planning creates superior outcomes compared to standalone housing programs.\n\n## References\n\n- Phang, S.
