  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the early 2000s, Georgia was widely considered one of the most corrupt countries in the former Soviet Union. Under President Eduard Shevardnadze, petty corruption pervaded daily life — from traffic police extracting bribes to teachers selling exam grades. The traffic police were so notoriously corrupt that surveys found citizens paying an average of $100 per encounter. Government institutions were dysfunctional, tax collection was minimal, and public services had effectively collapsed. Transparency International ranked Georgia 124th out of 133 countries in its 2003 Corruption Perceptions Index.\n\nThe November 2003 Rose Revolution — a peaceful uprising triggered by fraudulent parliamentary elections — brought Mikheil Saakashvili to power with an overwhelming mandate for reform. At 36, Saakashvili was US-educated and arrived with ambitious plans to transform Georgia's governance.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe reforms were radical in speed and scope. The most dramatic early move was the complete dissolution of the traffic police in 2004. All 16,000 officers were dismissed overnight, and for several months Georgia had no traffic enforcement at all. A new Patrol Police force of approximately 5,000 officers was then recruited, trained with US assistance, equipped with new vehicles and uniforms, and paid salaries five to ten times higher than before. Glass-walled police stations symbolized the commitment to transparency.\n\nThe broader anti-corruption strategy included: aggressive prosecution of corrupt officials (many were offered plea bargains involving asset forfeiture), radical deregulation and simplification of business procedures, a new tax code that reduced rates and simplified compliance, civil service reform with merit-based hiring, and the creation of one-stop-shop Public Service Halls (later Justice Houses) for citizen-government interactions.\n\nBusiness registration was reduced from weeks of bureaucratic process to a single day. The number of licenses and permits required was slashed from over 900 to fewer than 150. A flat income tax of 20% replaced a complex system, and a new Revenue Service dramatically improved tax collection.\n\nThe World Bank's \"Fighting Corruption in Public Services: Chronicling Georgia's Reforms\" (2012) documented the systematic approach, noting that speed, comprehensiveness, and visible results were key to building public support for continued reform.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe results were striking by multiple measures. Georgia's ranking on Transparency International's CPI improved from 124th in 2003 to 51st by 2012. The World Bank's Doing Business rankings placed Georgia in the top 20 globally by 2008, up from 137th in 2004. Tax revenue tripled between 2003 and 2008 even as tax rates were lowered. Foreign direct investment surged from $340 million in 2003 to $2 billion in 2007.\n\nPublic attitudes transformed. Surveys showed that public trust in police rose from under 10% to 84% by 2011. The percentage of citizens reporting paying bribes fell from 60% to under 5%. The new patrol police became a symbol of reform success and a source of national pride.\n\nDi Puppo (2010) analyzed the political economy of the reforms, noting that Saakashvili's overwhelming electoral mandate (96% in the 2004 presidential election) provided unusual political space for radical action. The concentration of executive power, while enabling rapid reform, also created governance risks.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe reforms came with significant democratic deficits. Saakashvili's government was criticized for selective justice — targeting political opponents while allowing allies to operate with impunity. Media independence deteriorated, particularly after the violent dispersal of opposition protests in November 2007. The 2008 war with Russia over South Ossetia exposed the risks of confrontational foreign policy.\n\nKupatadze (2012) argued that Georgia's anti-corruption success was \"elite-driven\" and lacked institutional depth — reforms depended on the personal commitment of the president rather than systemic checks and balances. When Saakashvili's party lost power in 2012, some reforms slowed and selective prosecution of former officials raised questions about politicized justice.\n\nThe economic benefits were unevenly distributed. Rural poverty remained high, inequality increased, and the informal economy, while reduced, persisted. Some critics argued that deregulation went too far, weakening labor protections and environmental oversight.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Radical, visible anti-corruption measures (such as dissolving an entire corrupt police force) can rapidly shift public expectations and norms\n- Higher public sector salaries are a necessary but not sufficient condition for reducing corruption; they must be paired with accountability mechanisms\n- Speed of reform can overcome resistance, but sustainability requires institutionalization beyond individual leaders\n- Anti-corruption gains can coexist with democratic backsliding if reforms are concentrated in executive power without adequate checks\n- International benchmarks (Doing Business, CPI) can serve as both motivators and accountability tools for reforming governments\n\n## References\n\n1.
