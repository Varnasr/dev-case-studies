The most visible success has been in mobile phone manufacturing, where Apple suppliers Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata Electronics, along with Samsung, have established large-scale production in India, driving mobile phone exports from $3 billion in FY2019-20 to over $15 billion in FY2023-24. However, results across other sectors — from textiles to specialty steel, from solar modules to white goods — have been deeply uneven, with several sectors seeing low application rates, delayed investments, and disbursement far below targets. The PLI scheme represents India's most explicit embrace of East Asian-style industrial policy since liberalization in 1991, marking a departure from the post-reform consensus against sector-specific government intervention. Verdict: A clear win in electronics manufacturing that has not yet proven replicable across the broader industrial economy, raising fundamental questions about the conditions under which industrial policy works.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nIndia's manufacturing sector has been a persistent underperformer. Despite three decades of economic reforms since 1991, manufacturing's share of GDP has stubbornly hovered between 14-17% — far below the 25-35% shares that characterized the industrialization phase of China, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. The 'Make in India' initiative launched by Prime Minister Modi in September 2014 set an ambitious target of raising manufacturing to 25% of GDP by 2025. By 2020, it was clear this target would be missed by a wide margin.\n\nThe structural constraints were well-documented: high logistics costs (14% of GDP versus 8% in China), unreliable power supply, complex labor laws, land acquisition difficulties, an inverted tariff structure that made it cheaper to import finished goods than raw materials, and a domestic market fragmented by state-level regulations. India's position in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings improved dramatically — from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in 2019 — but this did not translate proportionally into manufacturing investment.\n\nTwo external developments created urgency. First, the US-China trade war beginning in 2018 triggered a global reassessment of supply chain concentration in China. Multinationals actively sought 'China-plus-one' manufacturing locations, and India was a natural candidate given its market size, labor availability, and geopolitical alignment with the West. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 exposed the vulnerabilities of concentrated supply chains — India found itself dependent on Chinese imports for 70% of its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), critical electronic components, and solar modules.\n\nThe intellectual foundation for PLI drew on the acknowledged success of East Asian industrial policy — South Korea's chaebols, Taiwan's semiconductor strategy through ITRI and TSMC, China's Made in China 2025 — combined with a pragmatic recognition that India's horizontal reforms (tax, regulation, infrastructure) alone were insufficient to overcome the coordination failures and scale disadvantages that deterred manufacturing investment.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe PLI scheme was announced in three phases. The first, in March 2020, covered three sectors: mobile phones and electronic components, pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs/KSMs), and medical devices. The second, much larger phase in November 2020 expanded PLI to 10 additional sectors. A third addition (drones) came in 2021.\n\nThe 14 sectors covered by PLI, with their total incentive outlays, include:\n\n- Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing (including mobile phones): ₹40,951 crore\n- IT Hardware: ₹17,000 crore\n- Pharmaceuticals: ₹15,000 crore\n- Telecom & Networking Equipment: ₹12,195 crore\n- Automobiles & Auto Components: ₹25,938 crore\n- Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery: ₹18,100 crore\n- Solar PV Modules: ₹24,000 crore\n- White Goods (ACs, LEDs): ₹6,238 crore\n- Food Processing: ₹10,900 crore\n- Textile Products: ₹10,683 crore\n- Specialty Steel: ₹6,322 crore\n- Drones: ₹120 crore\n- High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules (expanded): Included in solar allocation\n- Medical Devices: ₹3,420 crore\n\nTotal committed outlay: approximately ₹1.97 lakh crore over 5-6 years.\n\nThe basic design is straightforward: companies that meet specified thresholds of incremental production (over a base year) receive a percentage incentive — typically 4-6% of incremental sales — for a defined period (usually 5 years). The incentive is paid as a cash disbursement after production targets are met and verified. This production-linked (output-based) design was a deliberate choice over the input-based subsidies (capital subsidies, tax holidays) that had characterized earlier Indian industrial policy.\n\nThe mobile phone PLI, designed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) under Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney, was the most carefully calibrated. It created two sub-schemes: one for global champion companies (targeting Apple's contract manufacturers and Samsung) investing in phones priced above ₹15,000, and another for domestic companies. Applicants committed to cumulative incremental investment and production targets over five years. Sixteen companies were approved, including Foxconn Hon Hai, Wistron (later acquired by Tata Electronics), Pegatron, Samsung, Dixon Technologies, Lava, and Micromax.\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe PLI scheme's theory of change operates through several channels:\n\n**Overcoming coordination failures.** Manufacturing ecosystems require simultaneous investment by assemblers, component suppliers, logistics providers, and service firms. No single actor will invest without confidence that the others will too. PLI incentives act as a coordination device — by guaranteeing returns to early movers, they reduce the risk of investing in a nascent ecosystem. In the mobile phone sector, Foxconn's investment in Tamil Nadu attracted component suppliers, which attracted more assemblers, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\n**Compensating for India's cost disadvantage.** Indian manufacturing faces structural cost disadvantages relative to China and Vietnam — higher logistics costs, power costs, compliance costs, and lower labor productivity (despite lower unit labor costs). The PLI incentive (4-6% of sales) was calibrated to approximately offset this cost gap for the incentive period, giving manufacturers time to achieve scale and drive down costs independently.\n\n**Signaling effect.** Beyond the direct fiscal incentive, PLI served as a policy signal that the Indian government was willing to actively support manufacturing, was open for business with global firms, and would provide stable, predictable fiscal support. This signaling effect was amplified by high-profile visits — Apple CEO Tim Cook's visit to India in April 2023, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu's multiple visits — that generated media coverage and investor attention.\n\n**Tariff complementarity.** PLI was accompanied by strategic tariff increases on finished goods (particularly electronics) to create a price wedge that made domestic manufacturing more competitive. Import duties on mobile phones were raised from 0% to 20% between 2017 and 2020. This combination of incentives (PLI) and protection (tariffs) mirrors the classic infant industry playbook.\n\n**Scale and export orientation.** Unlike earlier Indian industrial policy that focused on import substitution for the domestic market, PLI explicitly targeted export-capable scale. The mobile phone PLI required beneficiaries to produce at volumes and prices competitive in global markets. This export orientation — producing for Apple's global supply chain, not just the Indian market — imposed quality and efficiency discipline that domestic-only production would not.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\n**Mobile phones — the clear success.** India's mobile phone production rose from $24 billion in FY2019-20 to approximately $44 billion in FY2023-24. Exports surged from $3.2 billion to over $15 billion in the same period. India became the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer by volume, after China. Apple's production in India grew from effectively zero iPhones in 2017 to an estimated $14 billion worth in 2024, representing approximately 12-14% of Apple's global iPhone production. Foxconn invested over $1.5 billion in its Tamil Nadu operations. Tata Electronics acquired Wistron's plant in Karnataka and began assembling iPhones — the first Indian company to do so. Samsung expanded its Noida factory, already the world's largest mobile phone factory by area.\n\nThe PLI disbursement for large-scale electronics was approximately ₹6,600 crore through FY2023-24, against a total outlay of ₹40,951 crore. This relatively modest disbursement relative to the production surge suggests that the incentive catalyzed investment that was partly driven by global supply chain diversification dynamics — PLI was necessary but not sufficient, with the China-plus-one tailwind doing significant work.\n\n**IT Hardware — slow start, building momentum.** PLI for IT hardware (laptops, tablets, servers) was restructured after initial tepid response. The revised scheme attracted commitments from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Dixon Technologies. Production began in 2023-24, but volumes remain small relative to India's import bill for IT hardware ($8+ billion annually).\n\n**Pharmaceuticals — modest success.** The PLI for pharma attracted 55 approved applicants with ₹15,000 crore in committed investment. Production of critical APIs began at several plants, reducing import dependence for some bulk drugs. However, India remains dependent on China for over 60% of API imports by value. The fermentation-based API segment — the most China-dependent — has seen the slowest progress due to technology and scale barriers.\n\n**Automobiles — early stage.** The auto PLI, focused on Advanced Automotive Technology products (electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, advanced electronics), approved 85 companies with ₹67,690 crore in committed investment. However, actual disbursement through FY2023-24 was modest at approximately ₹800 crore, as most investments are still in the ramp-up phase.\n\n**Textiles — underperformance.** The textile PLI, targeting man-made fibre (MMF) apparel, MMF fabrics, and technical textiles, has been a disappointment. Of the 64 approved applicants, disbursement has been well below targets. Bangladesh and Vietnam continue to dominate global textile exports. India's structural challenges in textiles — fragmented firms, rigid labor laws, inadequate scale — have proven resistant to PLI incentives alone.\n\n**Solar modules — mixed.** The PLI for solar PV modules attracted strong interest from Adani, Reliance, Tata Power Solar, and others. Domestic solar cell/module manufacturing capacity is expanding. But the global solar market is dominated by Chinese manufacturers with massive scale and cost advantages — Chinese module prices fell below $0.10/watt in 2024, making it extremely difficult for Indian manufacturers to compete without continued protection.\n\n**Aggregate numbers.** As of early 2025, the government reported that PLI schemes across all 14 sectors had attracted investment of approximately ₹1.46 lakh crore, generated incremental production/sales of over ₹10.5 lakh crore, and created over 840,000 direct jobs. Total disbursement was approximately ₹12,000 crore — a fraction of the ₹1.97 lakh crore committed, partly because production in many sectors was still below threshold levels.\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**Sector selection and one-size-fits-all design.** The rapid expansion from 3 to 14 sectors diluted focus and applied a broadly similar incentive structure to sectors with fundamentally different competitive dynamics. Mobile phone assembly has relatively low barriers to entry (the technology is standardized, and contract manufacturers are seeking diversification) — making it amenable to incentive-based relocation. Sectors like specialty steel, advanced chemistry batteries, and semiconductors have much higher barriers (technology, IP, talent, supply chain depth) that production incentives alone cannot address.\n\n**Insufficient ecosystem development.** While iPhone assembly moved to India, the component ecosystem remains thin. India imports the vast majority of mobile phone components — displays, processors, memory chips, camera modules — from China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Domestic value addition in mobile phone manufacturing is estimated at only 15-20%. India is, in a sense, doing for mobile phones what it did for software services — providing relatively low-complexity assembly labor within a global value chain — rather than building deep manufacturing capability. This limits both the employment multiplier and the technology spillover effects.\n\n**Employment intensity.** The PLI scheme's employment impact, while positive, has been modest relative to India's needs. The 840,000 jobs reported across all sectors compare poorly with the 8-10 million youth entering the labor force annually. Manufacturing jobs in PLI-supported sectors tend to be capital-intensive (auto components, batteries) or of moderate quality (electronics assembly line work at ₹12,000-18,000 per month). PLI has not solved India's fundamental employment challenge.\n\n**Fiscal cost-benefit uncertainty.** The ₹1.97 lakh crore outlay is substantial — roughly equivalent to India's entire defence capital expenditure for two years. Whether the return on this investment — in terms of GDP growth, employment, exports, and tax revenue — justifies the cost is an open question. Unlike East Asian industrial policies, which included rigorous performance monitoring and sunset clauses, India's PLI disbursement criteria are primarily based on production volumes rather than technology acquisition, export competitiveness, or employment quality.\n\n**Comparison with East Asian industrial policy.** South Korea and Taiwan's industrial policies were embedded in a broader institutional framework: heavy investment in R&D and technical education, technology licensing requirements, performance-based export targets with real consequences for failure, state-owned development banks providing patient capital, and disciplined sunset provisions. India's PLI offers fiscal incentives but lacks many of these complementary elements. There is no Indian equivalent of ITRI (Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute), no systematic technology transfer mechanism, and limited coordination between PLI incentives and skills development or R&D policy.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. Industrial policy works best when it aligns with global supply chain dynamics, not against them.** The mobile phone PLI succeeded partly because global conditions (US-China tensions, Apple's diversification strategy) created demand for exactly what India was offering. Sectors where India was swimming against the global tide (textiles competing with Bangladesh's cost advantage, solar competing with China's massive scale) showed weaker results. Effective industrial policy requires a realistic assessment of where the global supply chain is creating openings.\n\n**2. Production incentives are insufficient without ecosystem development.** Assembly operations will relocate for incentives; deep manufacturing ecosystems will not. Building domestic component supply chains, investing in R&D infrastructure, developing specialized technical skills, and creating industrial clusters require complementary policies that go well beyond PLI's production-linked cash incentive. The next phase of India's industrial policy needs to shift from attracting assembly to deepening value chains.\n\n**3. Fewer sectors with deeper support may outperform broad, shallow coverage.** The expansion from 3 to 14 sectors reflected political economy pressures — every sector lobby wanted its PLI — but diluted administrative focus and fiscal impact. East Asian success stories typically involved deep commitment to a few strategic sectors, not thin incentives spread across many. India may need to concentrate its industrial policy resources more aggressively.\n\n**4. Performance monitoring must go beyond production volumes.** If the goal is to build domestic manufacturing capability — not just assemble imported components — then PLI metrics should include domestic value addition, R&D expenditure, technology licensing, local supplier development, and export market diversification. Production volume alone is a poor proxy for industrial deepening.\n\n**5. Industrial policy is a complement to horizontal reforms, not a substitute.** PLI can compensate for India's cost disadvantage temporarily, but it cannot solve the underlying structural problems — logistics inefficiency, power costs, land acquisition difficulty, skill gaps — that make Indian manufacturing uncompetitive. Without continued horizontal reforms, PLI beneficiaries will need perpetual incentives, creating fiscal dependency rather than self-sustaining competitiveness.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value | Year/Period |\n|---|---|---|\n| Total PLI outlay (committed) | ₹1.97 lakh crore | Over 5-6 years |\n| Sectors covered | 14 | 2020-21 onward |\n| Mobile phone production | $44 billion | FY 2023-24 |\n| Mobile phone exports | $15.6 billion | FY 2023-24 |\n| Apple's India production (est.) | $14 billion | 2024 |\n| Investment attracted (all sectors) | ₹1.46 lakh crore | As of early 2025 |\n| Jobs created (reported) | 840,000+ | As of early 2025 |\n| Total PLI disbursement | ~₹12,000 crore | Through FY 2023-24 |\n| Domestic value addition in mobile phones | 15-20% | 2024 est. |\n| India's mobile phone import duty | 20% | 2020 onward |\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

PLI represents a partial return to selective intervention. Under what conditions is it appropriate for governments to 'pick winners' through sector-specific incentives? How should policymakers decide which sectors to target, and what exit criteria should apply when sectors fail to meet expectations?\n\n2. **Assembly vs. deep manufacturing:** India's mobile phone success is primarily in assembly — importing components and assembling finished devices — rather than deep manufacturing of components. Is assembly a necessary stepping stone to deeper industrialization (as it was for China in the 2000s), or does India risk getting stuck in low-value assembly indefinitely? What specific policies could accelerate the transition from assembly to component manufacturing?\n\n3. **The China comparison:** China's industrial policy succeeded in building globally competitive firms (Huawei, BYD, CATL, LONGi) through a combination of massive domestic market scale, state-directed finance, technology transfer requirements, and aggressive R&D investment. India's PLI scheme is a much more modest intervention. Can India achieve comparable manufacturing depth through PLI-style incentives alone, or does it need a fundamentally different scale of state intervention — and is such intervention politically and institutionally feasible in India's democratic, federal system?"
