  "content": "## Background\n\nEl Salvador's dollarization occurred in a fundamentally different context from Ecuador's. Whereas Ecuador dollarized in the midst of a severe financial crisis as an emergency measure, El Salvador adopted the dollar during a period of relative macroeconomic stability. The colón had been effectively pegged to the dollar at 8.75:1 since 1993, inflation was already low at approximately 4%, and the banking system was functioning normally.\n\nThe decision was driven primarily by the ARENA government's desire to deepen financial integration with the United States, reduce transaction costs for the country's massive remittance flows, lower interest rates by eliminating currency risk, and attract foreign investment. El Salvador received approximately US$1.9 billion in remittances in 2000 (about 14% of GDP), and the cost of converting dollars to colones imposed a de facto tax on these transfers.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Ley de Integración Monetaria (Monetary Integration Law) was passed on November 30, 2000, and took effect on January 1, 2001. Unlike Ecuador's emergency dollarization, El Salvador's transition was planned and orderly. The law declared both the dollar and the colón legal tender, though the colón was to be phased out over time. Bank accounts were converted at the fixed rate of 8.75 colones per dollar, and all new financial contracts were denominated in dollars.\n\nThe Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador retained some regulatory and supervisory functions but lost its core monetary policy tools—it could no longer set interest rates, control the money supply, or serve as lender of last resort. Interest rates were expected to converge toward US levels, and the elimination of devaluation risk was intended to encourage foreign investment.\n\nThe transition was implemented rapidly. Within six months, the dollar had effectively replaced the colón in daily transactions, though the colón remained legal tender. By 2003, the colón had essentially disappeared from circulation.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nQuispe-Agnoli and Whisler (2006), writing for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, provided a comparative analysis of dollarization in El Salvador and Ecuador. They found that El Salvador's inflation converged to US levels, falling from approximately 4% to 2% on average. Interest rates on loans declined by 2–4 percentage points in the first years, reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.\n\nHowever, the growth impact was disappointing. GDP growth averaged approximately 2.3% annually from 2001 to 2019—among the lowest in Latin America and well below the region's average of approximately 3%. The expected surge in foreign direct investment did not materialize at the anticipated scale. Towers and Borzutzky (2004) argued that dollarization alone was insufficient to overcome El Salvador's structural growth constraints, including low productivity, limited human capital, infrastructure deficits, and institutional weaknesses.\n\nRemittances continued to grow, reaching approximately US$6 billion by 2019 (24% of GDP), and the elimination of currency conversion costs did reduce transaction friction. However, the growth of remittances also reflected increasing emigration driven by violence and poverty—not a sign of economic success.\n\nHinds (2006) noted that dollarization facilitated the integration of El Salvador's banking system into the international financial system, enabling several Salvadoran banks to be acquired by international institutions. This deepened financial integration but also raised concerns about the loss of domestic control over credit allocation.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe loss of monetary policy has been particularly consequential during asymmetric shocks. When US monetary policy tightened to address domestic conditions, the effects transmitted directly to El Salvador regardless of its own economic cycle. During the 2008 global financial crisis, El Salvador could not lower interest rates or use quantitative easing to stimulate the economy.\n\nThe absence of a lender of last resort creates vulnerability in the banking system. Without the ability to inject liquidity in a crisis, the Central Bank must maintain large reserves as a buffer—tying up resources that could otherwise be deployed productively.\n\nCritics from the left have argued that dollarization was designed to benefit the financial elite and foreign investors at the expense of ordinary Salvadorans. The inability to use exchange rate depreciation to boost export competitiveness has been particularly damaging for the agricultural sector and manufacturing.\n\nDollarization has also limited the government's fiscal flexibility. Without the ability to monetize deficits, the government has relied on external borrowing, contributing to rising debt levels that reached approximately 85% of GDP by 2020.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Dollarization from a position of stability yields more modest benefits than crisis-driven dollarization, as the baseline conditions are already relatively favorable\n- Eliminating currency risk alone is insufficient to drive economic growth when structural constraints remain binding\n- Remittance-dependent economies benefit from reduced transaction costs under dollarization, but this does not address the root causes of emigration\n- The loss of monetary policy is most acutely felt during asymmetric shocks when the domestic economic cycle diverges from US conditions\n- Financial integration through dollarization can facilitate foreign acquisition of the banking system, with ambiguous welfare effects\n\n## References\n\n1.
