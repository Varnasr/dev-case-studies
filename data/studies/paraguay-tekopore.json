  "content": "## Background\n\nParaguay has historically had among the highest poverty and inequality rates in South America. Extreme poverty affected approximately 16% of the population in the mid-2000s, with significantly higher rates in rural areas and among indigenous communities. The country's Guaraní-speaking indigenous and mestizo rural population faced limited access to education, health services, and civil registration systems.\n\nParaguay was a relatively late adopter of conditional cash transfers, implementing Tekoporã in 2005—several years after neighboring Brazil, Argentina, and Bolivia had established their programs. The country's limited fiscal capacity, weak institutional infrastructure, and the political legacy of the Stroessner dictatorship (1954–1989) had constrained social policy development. The program name, Tekoporã, means \"good living\" or \"living well\" in Guaraní, reflecting the program's cultural orientation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nTekoporã provides monthly cash transfers of approximately Gs 370,000 (about US$52) to households in extreme poverty, with additional per-child supplements. The transfer is conditional on children's enrollment in school, regular health check-ups for children under five and pregnant women, and participation in community development activities. Unusually, the program also requires beneficiary households to obtain civil identification documents—addressing the significant problem of unregistered births and undocumented populations in rural Paraguay.\n\nThe program is administered by the Secretaría de Acción Social (SAS), later reorganized as the Secretaría Técnica de Planificación del Desarrollo Económico y Social. Targeting uses the Sistema Integrado de Información Social (SIIS), a social information system that combines geographic targeting of the poorest districts with household-level proxy means testing.\n\nThe geographic rollout prioritized Paraguay's poorest departments—Caazapá, San Pedro, Caaguazú—and districts with the highest rates of extreme poverty and chronic malnutrition. A distinctive feature is the indigenous component, which provides specialized outreach to Paraguay's 19 indigenous groups, who face the most severe deprivation. Approximately 20,000 indigenous families are enrolled in an adapted version of the program that accounts for cultural practices, community structures, and the particular barriers indigenous populations face in accessing health and education services.\n\nTekoporã also includes a family accompaniment (acompañamiento familiar) component, in which social workers visit beneficiary households to provide guidance on health, nutrition, education, and productive activities. This accompaniment model was influenced by Chile Solidario's Puente program.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nVeras Soares, Ribas, and Hirata (2008), in an influential study for the International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG), evaluated Tekoporã's early impact using propensity score matching. They found significant positive effects on school enrollment, particularly for children aged 6–14, with an increase of approximately 4 percentage points. The study also documented improvements in food consumption and dietary diversity among beneficiary households.\n\nThe evaluation found that the civil registration conditionality was particularly impactful, as many beneficiary households obtained birth certificates and identity documents for the first time—enabling access to other public services beyond the program itself.\n\nThe World Bank (2017) assessed the program's targeting performance, finding that approximately 70% of beneficiary households were in the poorest quintile. While this represented reasonable targeting accuracy, the evaluation noted significant under-coverage: many eligible households in extreme poverty were not reached, particularly in remote areas.\n\nAcosta et al. (2011) examined the nutritional effects and found improvements in food security indicators, though the impact on child stunting was limited—consistent with evidence from other CCT programs suggesting that cash transfers alone are insufficient to address chronic malnutrition without complementary nutrition-specific interventions.\n\nThe program expanded significantly under President Fernando Lugo (2008–2012), who made social protection a political priority. Coverage increased from approximately 14,000 households in 2008 to over 100,000 by 2012.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nParaguay's limited fiscal capacity constrains the program's reach. Public social spending remains among the lowest in South America, and Tekoporã's budget has been vulnerable to political pressures and competing fiscal demands. The country's tax-to-GDP ratio of approximately 13% limits the resources available for social protection.\n\nSupply-side constraints in health and education undermine the effectiveness of conditionalities. In many targeted districts, schools are understaffed and health facilities are distant or poorly equipped. Requiring families to use services that are inadequate or inaccessible raises questions about the fairness of conditionality.\n\nThe indigenous component, while innovative, faces implementation challenges. Cultural and linguistic barriers, geographic isolation, and the mismatch between Western institutional requirements and indigenous community practices complicate program delivery. Some indigenous leaders have criticized the individual household targeting approach as inconsistent with community-based resource sharing traditions.\n\nPolitical discontinuity has affected the program. Changes in government have brought shifts in program management, targeting criteria, and benefit levels, undermining institutional stability.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Civil registration conditionalities can address a fundamental barrier to social inclusion by ensuring undocumented populations gain legal identity\n- Indigenous targeting requires culturally adapted approaches that respect community structures and address specific barriers to access\n- Family accompaniment models can enhance CCT effectiveness but require sustained investment in trained social workers\n- Even well-targeted cash transfers are insufficient to address chronic malnutrition without complementary nutrition-specific interventions\n- Social protection in low-fiscal-capacity countries requires deliberate institutional strengthening and sustained political commitment\n\n## References\n\n1.
