  "content": "## Background\n\nTimor-Leste (East Timor) gained formal independence in 2002 after a traumatic history—Portuguese colonization until 1975, Indonesian occupation from 1975 to 1999 during which an estimated 100,000–180,000 people died, and a destructive transition in 1999 when Indonesian-backed militias destroyed approximately 70% of the country's infrastructure following the independence referendum. The new nation was one of the poorest in Asia, with virtually no administrative capacity, destroyed infrastructure, and a population of approximately 1 million people.\n\nHowever, Timor-Leste possessed significant petroleum reserves in the Timor Sea. The Bayu-Undan oil and gas field, located in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) shared with Australia, began production in 2004 and generated substantial revenues. The maritime boundary dispute with Australia—which had negotiated advantageous arrangements with Indonesia during the occupation—was a defining political issue, eventually resolved through the 2018 Treaty on Maritime Boundaries that gave Timor-Leste sovereign rights over the Greater Sunrise field.\n\nRecognizing the risks of the resource curse, Timor-Leste's leaders—advised by international experts including from Norway and the World Bank—designed the Petroleum Fund as a mechanism to manage oil revenues prudently for current and future generations. The 2005 Petroleum Fund Law, drafted with support from the IMF and Norwegian government, was widely praised as a model of resource governance for a new nation.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Petroleum Fund of Timor-Leste, established under the Petroleum Fund Law (2005), was modeled partly on Norway's Government Pension Fund Global. All petroleum revenues flow into the fund, which is invested in a diversified portfolio of international financial assets—initially US Treasury bonds, later expanded to include equities and other instruments. The fund is managed by the Banking and Payments Authority of Timor-Leste (now the Central Bank), with operational management contracted to international fund managers.\n\nThe fund's cornerstone fiscal rule is the Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI), calculated as 3% of total petroleum wealth (the current fund balance plus the net present value of expected future petroleum revenues). The ESI is intended to represent the maximum annual withdrawal that can be sustained indefinitely without depleting the fund in real terms. Withdrawals above the ESI require parliamentary approval with an explanation of how excess spending will benefit future generations.\n\nScheiner (2015) and the civil society organization La'o Hamutuk provided sustained independent monitoring of the fund, tracking actual withdrawals against ESI limits, analyzing investment performance, and scrutinizing government budget proposals. La'o Hamutuk's analyses consistently highlighted that actual government spending exceeded the ESI, drawing down the fund's capital rather than living off investment returns, and that the depletion of Bayu-Undan production was making the fiscal position increasingly precarious.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe Petroleum Fund achieved remarkable scale relative to the country's size. The fund balance reached a peak of approximately $19 billion in 2014—over $15,000 per capita in a country where GDP per capita (non-oil) was approximately $1,500. Investment returns were generally positive, and the fund's transparency—with quarterly reports published online and accessible to citizens—set a standard for resource governance in developing countries.\n\nThe Transparency International corruption perception index showed Timor-Leste performing better than many resource-rich developing countries, though governance challenges remained significant. The fund was credited with imposing some fiscal discipline and with avoiding the most extreme patterns of resource curse mismanagement seen in other petrostates.\n\nHowever, the fundamental problem has been excessive withdrawals. The government consistently exceeded the ESI, particularly from 2008 onward, as spending increased on large infrastructure projects (roads, ports, airports), public-sector employment, and social transfers. Between 2010 and 2020, withdrawals exceeded the ESI in every year, effectively drawing down the fund's capital. With Bayu-Undan production ending around 2023, the fund ceased receiving new revenue inflows, and the combination of ongoing withdrawals and no new revenue means the fund is projected to be depleted by the mid-2030s without major fiscal adjustment or new revenue sources.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe impending depletion of the Petroleum Fund represents an existential fiscal challenge. Approximately 90% of the state budget is financed by Petroleum Fund withdrawals, and non-oil domestic revenues cover only a fraction of government expenditure. Diversifying the economy away from petroleum dependence has progressed slowly; agriculture, tourism, and fisheries have potential but require sustained investment and institutional development that has been difficult to achieve.\n\nThe development impact of petroleum spending has been questioned. Despite over $23 billion in total petroleum revenues since 2004, Timor-Leste's human development indicators remain among the lowest in the region. Child stunting affects approximately 47% of children under five (2020), one of the highest rates in the world. Infrastructure investments, while visible, have sometimes been criticized as poorly planned or executed—including the Tasi Mane petroleum infrastructure project on the south coast, which consumed billions of dollars with uncertain returns. La'o Hamutuk and Scheiner (2015) argued that the Tasi Mane project represented a gamble on an unproven downstream petroleum industry rather than a prudent diversification strategy.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Establishing resource revenue management institutions early—even before major revenues flow—is easier than reforming entrenched systems, and Timor-Leste's early adoption of the Petroleum Fund Law was commendable.\n- Fiscal rules like the ESI provide useful benchmarks but are ineffective without political commitment to enforcement; parliamentary override provisions can become routine rather than exceptional.\n- Transparency and independent monitoring (as provided by La'o Hamutuk) are necessary but insufficient conditions for fiscal discipline; political incentives to spend often override technical advice.\n- Resource-dependent countries face a narrow window to translate finite petroleum revenues into sustainable economic diversification; once the window closes, options narrow dramatically.\n- The experience of the world's newest nation managing one of the largest per-capita sovereign wealth funds offers both inspiration (the institutional design) and caution (the spending trajectory).\n\n## References\n\n- Scheiner, C.
