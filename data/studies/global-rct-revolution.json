  "content": "## Background\n\nFor decades, development economics relied primarily on cross-country regressions, structural models, and case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. These methods were plagued by endogeneity problems: it was difficult to determine whether observed correlations reflected causal relationships or confounding factors. Countries that received more aid might differ systematically from those that received less, making it impossible to isolate the effect of aid itself.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a new generation of development economists began applying randomized controlled trials (RCTs), long the gold standard in medical research, to development questions. Michael Kremer's pioneering study of deworming and school attendance in Kenya (begun in 1998) demonstrated that rigorous experimental methods could be applied in field settings to generate actionable policy evidence.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) was founded at MIT in 2003 by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo to serve as a hub for randomized evaluations in development economics. J-PAL's mission was to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy was informed by scientific evidence, specifically by conducting and synthesizing RCTs of development interventions.\n\nThe approach involved partnering with governments, NGOs, and international organizations to randomly assign communities, schools, clinics, or individuals to treatment and control groups. By comparing outcomes between these groups, researchers could isolate the causal effect of specific interventions with high internal validity.\n\nKremer's original study in western Kenya randomly assigned schools to receive free deworming treatment and found dramatic effects on school attendance. This was followed by a wave of influential RCTs across multiple domains. Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan (2012) used camera-based monitoring to reduce teacher absenteeism in India. Banerjee et al. (2007) evaluated Pratham's remedial education program in India, finding large learning gains from targeted teaching. Dupas (2011) demonstrated that even small subsidies dramatically increased bed net adoption in Kenya.\n\nThe movement expanded rapidly. J-PAL established regional offices in South Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, and North America. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), founded by Dean Karlan in 2002, became another major hub for field experiments. By 2023, J-PAL affiliates had completed over 1,000 RCTs across 80 countries.\n\nThe 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, awarded to Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer \"for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty,\" validated the movement's impact. The Nobel committee highlighted how their work had transformed development economics from a theoretical discipline into an empirically rigorous field generating practical policy guidance.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe RCT revolution has generated a vast body of evidence across development domains. In education, the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, evaluated through multiple J-PAL RCTs in India and Africa, demonstrated that grouping children by learning level rather than age and providing targeted instruction could dramatically improve basic literacy and numeracy. This evidence informed government policy in India (reaching tens of millions of children) and was adopted in multiple African countries.\n\nIn health, RCTs demonstrated the importance of free or heavily subsidized distribution of preventive health products. Cohen and Dupas (2010) showed that charging even small prices for bed nets dramatically reduced take-up without improving targeting. Kremer and Miguel's deworming evidence informed WHO policy and mass deworming campaigns reaching hundreds of millions of children.\n\nIn governance, Olken (2007) used an RCT to compare top-down audits versus community-based monitoring for reducing corruption in Indonesian road projects, finding that audits were more effective. This kind of evidence challenged assumptions about community participation and informed anti-corruption policy.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nAngus Deaton (2010) articulated the most influential critique in his presidential address to the American Economic Association. He argued that while RCTs had high internal validity (correctly identifying causal effects within the study context), they often had limited external validity: results from one setting might not generalize to others. A deworming program that worked in western Kenya might not produce the same effects in a different epidemiological or institutional context.\n\nPritchett and Sandefur (2015) demonstrated empirically that the results of development RCTs were highly context-dependent, with effect sizes varying substantially across settings. They argued that this undermined the claim that RCTs provided universal policy guidance.\n\nCritics also contended that the focus on small, randomizable interventions biased research toward questions amenable to experimental methods while neglecting larger structural issues, such as industrial policy, macroeconomic management, institutional reform, and political economy, that were difficult or impossible to randomize but potentially far more consequential for development.\n\nRavallion (2020) noted that ethical concerns could limit RCT applicability, particularly when denying treatment to control groups involved withholding essential services.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Randomized evaluations can provide high-quality causal evidence on specific development interventions, overcoming persistent identification problems\n- Evidence from RCTs is most useful when combined with theory and contextual understanding to assess generalizability\n- The experimental approach is better suited to evaluating discrete programs than assessing systemic or structural changes\n- Building infrastructure for evidence generation (research labs, partnerships, data systems) creates lasting capacity for evidence-informed policy\n- Policy adoption of RCT evidence requires active engagement with policymakers beyond academic publication\n\n## References\n\n1.
