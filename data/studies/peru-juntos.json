  "content": "## Background\n\nPeru entered the 21st century with severe spatial inequality: while Lima and the coastal cities experienced moderate prosperity, the rural Sierra (Andean highlands) and Selva (Amazon lowlands) remained deeply impoverished. In 2004, rural poverty exceeded 70% in the poorest Andean departments (Huancavelica, Apurímac, Ayacucho, Huánuco), with chronic child malnutrition rates above 40%. These regions — many of which had been devastated by the internal armed conflict between the Shining Path and the military (1980–2000) — had limited infrastructure, few economic opportunities, and weak public service delivery.\n\nInspired by the success of Mexico's Progresa and Brazil's Bolsa Família, the Toledo administration launched Juntos (meaning \"Together\") in April 2005 as Peru's first national conditional cash transfer program. It initially targeted 70 of the country's poorest districts, all in the rural Sierra.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nJuntos provides a bimonthly cash transfer of S/200 (approximately $55) per household — regardless of the number of children — conditional on children's school attendance (at least 85%), regular health check-ups for children under 5, participation in the CRED (Control de Crecimiento y Desarrollo) growth monitoring program, and prenatal care attendance for pregnant women.\n\nTargeting follows a two-stage process: geographic targeting first identifies the poorest districts based on composite poverty indices (combining income poverty, unmet basic needs, and vulnerability), followed by household-level verification using community-based assessment and proxy means testing. The program focuses heavily on rural indigenous communities, with a significant share of beneficiaries being Quechua- and Aymara-speaking households.\n\nTransfers are paid through the Banco de la Nación (the state bank) using individual bank accounts, which in many cases represent beneficiaries' first interaction with the formal financial system. The bimonthly payment schedule reflects the logistical challenges of payment delivery in remote areas where beneficiaries may need to travel hours to reach the nearest bank branch.\n\nA critical institutional development came in 2011 with the creation of the Ministerio de Desarrollo e Inclusión Social (MIDIS), which consolidated Peru's fragmented social programs under a single ministry. Juntos became MIDIS's flagship program, and its coordination with other programs — particularly Qali Warma (school feeding), Cuna Más (early childhood development), and Pensión 65 (elderly pension) — improved significantly.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nPerova and Vakis (2012) in a comprehensive World Bank evaluation found that Juntos had significant positive impacts across multiple dimensions. School enrollment increased by approximately 5 percentage points, with the largest effects at the secondary school level in rural areas. The program reduced the poverty gap by 14% among beneficiary households and decreased the incidence of extreme poverty.\n\nHealth-related behaviors showed substantial improvement: prenatal care visits increased significantly, as did growth monitoring attendance for children under 5. Sánchez and Jaramillo (2012) found that Juntos increased the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals in beneficiary communities, an important outcome given historically high rates of unattended births in rural Peru.\n\nDíaz and Saldarriaga (2014) found modest but positive nutritional impacts: chronic malnutrition rates declined faster in Juntos-covered districts than in comparable non-covered districts, though the effects were smaller than hoped, suggesting that cash alone — without improvements in water, sanitation, and nutrition education — was insufficient to fully address chronic malnutrition.\n\nThe program also had indirect effects on local economies. Escobal and Benites (2012) found that Juntos transfers were largely spent locally, stimulating demand in small rural market towns and potentially generating multiplier effects in isolated Andean economies.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe flat transfer amount per household (regardless of family size) has been criticized as inequitable, as larger families receive less per child. This design choice was pragmatic — simplifying administration — but may disadvantage larger families in extreme poverty.\n\nConditionality enforcement has been inconsistent, particularly in the most remote areas where verifying school attendance and health visits is logistically difficult. Supply-side constraints are severe: many beneficiary communities have poorly equipped and understaffed schools and health posts, meaning that conditionalities may force attendance at inadequate facilities. The 2018 MIDIS evaluation found that only about 60% of beneficiary households fully met all conditionalities.\n\nCultural tensions have emerged in some indigenous communities where the program's requirements (institutional birth attendance, specific health practices) conflict with traditional practices. The program has been accused of imposing urban-centric health models on indigenous populations without adequate cultural adaptation.\n\nThe program's impact on chronic malnutrition, while positive, fell short of expectations, leading to a broader recognition that demand-side interventions (cash transfers) must be complemented by supply-side improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure, nutrition education, and health service quality.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Conditional cash transfers can significantly improve school enrollment and health service utilization in extremely poor rural areas, but impacts depend on the quality of available services\n- Creating a dedicated social inclusion ministry (MIDIS) can improve coordination among fragmented social programs and strengthen policy coherence\n- Bank account access through transfer programs can serve as a gateway to financial inclusion for previously unbanked populations\n- Addressing chronic malnutrition requires complementary investments in water, sanitation, and nutrition services beyond cash transfers\n- Programs targeting indigenous populations require cultural sensitivity and adaptation of conditionality requirements to local contexts\n\n## References\n\n1.
