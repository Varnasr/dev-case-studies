  "content": "## Background\n\nGhana's cocoa sector has been central to the country's political economy since the colonial era. Cocoa was the primary engine of Ghana's economy at independence in 1957, contributing over 60% of export earnings. The Cocoa Marketing Board (now Ghana Cocoa Board, or COCOBOD) was established in 1947 to manage purchasing, quality control, and marketing. However, decades of extractive policies—including the use of cocoa revenue to fund industrialization and government spending—progressively depressed producer prices and undermined production incentives.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Ghana's cocoa sector had collapsed. Production fell from a peak of approximately 560,000 metric tons in 1964/65 to just 159,000 metric tons in 1983/84. Real producer prices had declined to a fraction of their earlier levels, smuggling to neighboring Cote d'Ivoire (where prices were higher) was rampant, cocoa farms were aging and diseased, and rural infrastructure had deteriorated. The Economic Recovery Programme launched in 1983 under the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) and supported by the IMF and World Bank included cocoa sector rehabilitation as a priority.\n\nThe debate over cocoa sector reform centered on the role of COCOBOD. The World Bank advocated full liberalization—eliminating the marketing board and allowing private companies to buy directly from farmers and export, as was eventually done in Cote d'Ivoire. The Ghanaian government resisted, arguing that COCOBOD's quality control function maintained Ghana's premium reputation (Ghanaian cocoa commanded a price premium of $50-100 per ton over other origins) and that the guaranteed minimum price provided smallholders with stability.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe reform that emerged was a compromise: partial liberalization that preserved COCOBOD's core functions while introducing competition at the internal buying stage. Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) were authorized from 1993 to purchase cocoa from farmers at a government-set minimum price, competing with COCOBOD's own buying subsidiary (Produce Buying Company, PBC). COCOBOD retained monopoly control over external marketing, quality assurance (through the Quality Control Company), and the setting of producer prices.\n\nProducer prices were progressively increased as part of the reform. The government committed to passing through an increasing share of the FOB (free on board) export price to farmers, reaching a target of approximately 70% by the mid-2000s. This was operationalized through annual producer price announcements by COCOBOD before each main crop season, providing farmers with price certainty. Additionally, COCOBOD maintained input subsidy programs—particularly for fertilizer and pesticides—and financed disease control programs, most notably mass spraying campaigns against cocoa swollen shoot virus and black pod disease.\n\nThe government also invested in cocoa research through the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG), which developed improved hybrid varieties, and in cocoa roads (feeder roads in cocoa-growing areas funded by cocoa revenue). A Cocoa Farmers' Pension Scheme was introduced in 2004, and the COCOBOD Scholarship Trust Fund provided educational support for farmers' children.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nProduction recovered dramatically, from the low of 159,000 metric tons in 1983/84 to over 1 million metric tons by 2010/11. This recovery reflected both the producer price increases and the expansion of cocoa cultivation into new forest areas, particularly in the Western Region. Ghana maintained its reputation for high-quality cocoa, with the premium pricing supporting higher farmgate returns.\n\nVigneri and Santos (2007), in an International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) working paper, analyzed Ghana's cocoa sector reforms and concluded that the combination of increased producer prices, competition among LBCs, and maintained quality control contributed to the production recovery. They argued that Ghana's partial liberalization outperformed Cote d'Ivoire's full liberalization in terms of quality maintenance and price stability, though Cote d'Ivoire produced larger volumes.\n\nBreisinger et al. (2008), in an IFPRI study, estimated the multiplier effects of cocoa sector growth on the broader Ghanaian economy, finding significant linkages to rural non-farm income and poverty reduction. The World Bank's analysis of Ghana's poverty reduction between 1991 and 2006—during which the national poverty rate fell from 51.7% to 28.5%—identified cocoa sector recovery as one of the primary drivers, particularly for rural poverty reduction in cocoa-growing regions.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nChild labor remained the sector's most damning challenge. The 2018/19 NORC assessment, commissioned by the US Department of Labor, found that approximately 770,000 children were engaged in hazardous work in cocoa production in Ghana, and that child labor prevalence had actually increased since the Harkin-Engel Protocol commitment of 2001. Despite industry pledges and government programs, the structural drivers—farmer poverty, lack of alternative labor, and inadequate rural services—remained largely unaddressed.\n\nDeforestation was equally severe. Ghana lost approximately 80% of its forest cover between 1990 and 2020, with cocoa expansion being a primary driver. The creation of new cocoa farms through forest clearing, rather than intensification on existing land, accounted for much of the production increase. The European Union's 2023 Deforestation Regulation, requiring proof that commodities were not produced on recently deforested land, created significant compliance challenges for Ghana's cocoa sector and threatened market access.\n\nFarmer poverty persisted despite the production recovery. With average farm sizes of 2-3 hectares, aging trees, and producer prices that—despite improvements—still left most farmers well below a living income, the fundamental economics of smallholder cocoa farming remained precarious. Studies by Fairtrade International and others estimated that the majority of Ghanaian cocoa farmers earned well below the World Bank's international poverty line. COCOBOD's own financial sustainability was questioned, with significant debts accumulated through syndicated loan facilities used to pre-finance cocoa purchases.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- **Partial liberalization can outperform full deregulation in some contexts**: Ghana's retention of COCOBOD's quality control and price-setting functions maintained quality premiums and price stability while allowing competition in internal buying.\n- **Producer price increases are necessary but insufficient for poverty reduction**: While higher farmgate prices incentivized production, they did not by themselves address the structural poverty of smallholder cocoa farmers with small, aging farms.\n- **Quality institutions have long-term economic value**: Ghana's cocoa premium, maintained through COCOBOD's quality assurance, generated hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue over decades.\n- **Commodity sector growth without environmental safeguards leads to deforestation**: The production recovery was achieved partly through forest destruction, creating long-term environmental and regulatory risks.\n- **Child labor in agriculture requires structural solutions**: Voluntary industry commitments and targeted programs proved insufficient against the structural drivers of child labor, including farmer poverty, labor scarcity, and inadequate public services.\n\n## References\n\n- Vigneri, M. and Santos, P.
