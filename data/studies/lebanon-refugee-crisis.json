  "content": "## Background\n\nLebanon's crisis is the compounding of two interconnected emergencies: the massive influx of Syrian refugees since 2011 and the economic and financial collapse that accelerated from October 2019. Before the Syrian conflict, Lebanon already faced structural vulnerabilities: a sectarian power-sharing system (confessionalism) that impeded governance reform, a Ponzi-like banking model that attracted deposits through unsustainably high interest rates, mounting public debt exceeding 150% of GDP, and weak public services.\n\nThe arrival of approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees (alongside roughly 500,000 Palestinian refugees already in Lebanon) increased the population by roughly 25-30%, placing extraordinary pressure on infrastructure, housing, labor markets, and public services. Lebanon's government refused to establish formal refugee camps, meaning Syrians settled in existing communities, informal tented settlements, and urban areas, particularly in the Bekaa Valley, North Lebanon, and Beirut's suburbs.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe international response operated on multiple tracks. UNHCR coordinated the refugee response, though Lebanon's government imposed restrictions including refusing to allow new refugee registrations after 2015. The Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), jointly produced by the government and UN, sought over $2 billion annually for both refugee and host community support.\n\nThe Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), funded primarily by the EU and implemented through the World Food Programme, provided monthly cash assistance to approximately 200,000 vulnerable refugee families. Cash transfers, delivered through ATM cards, typically amounted to $175 per family per month. The World Bank's Global Concessional Financing Facility provided Lebanon with concessional loans for education, health, and municipal services under the framework established by the Jordan Compact model.\n\nEducation interventions enrolled approximately 200,000 Syrian children in Lebanese public schools through a second-shift system, funded primarily by international donors. Health services were supported through UNHCR subsidies for primary and secondary care.\n\nThe economic collapse, triggered by the October 2019 popular uprising and compounded by the August 2020 Beirut port explosion, led to an IMF Staff-Level Agreement in April 2022 for a $3 billion programme, conditional on financial sector restructuring and governance reforms.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe World Bank's Lebanon Economic Monitor (2021) described the crisis as a \"deliberate depression,\" attributing it to deliberate policy inaction by a ruling elite that had benefited from the unsustainable financial model. GDP per capita fell from approximately $8,000 in 2019 to under $3,500 by 2021. The Lebanese pound, officially pegged at 1,507 to the dollar, collapsed to over 100,000 on the parallel market by 2023.\n\nSalloukh (2019) analyzed how Lebanon's sectarian political system created a governance trap: reform was blocked because it would disrupt the patronage networks that sustained political elites. The banking sector collapse was particularly devastating: an estimated $100 billion in deposits were effectively frozen or lost, wiping out the savings of the middle class.\n\nFor refugees, conditions deteriorated dramatically. UNHCR's Vulnerability Assessment found that by 2022, over 80% of Syrian refugees in Lebanon lived in extreme poverty, unable to afford basic food and necessities. Food insecurity increased sharply as the currency collapse eroded the purchasing power of cash assistance. Nine out of ten refugee families were in debt.\n\nThe ESSN programme, while providing critical support, reached only a fraction of those in need. The education second-shift system strained Lebanese public schools and faced quality concerns, with high dropout rates among Syrian children.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nLebanon's refusal to establish formal refugee frameworks, allow camp construction, or grant work rights created an exploitative informal economy where Syrians faced low wages, no legal protections, and periodic crackdowns. Political leaders instrumentalized the refugee presence, blaming Syrians for economic problems that were largely structural and pre-existing.\n\nThe international community's failure to secure burden-sharing left Lebanon disproportionately affected. Resettlement to third countries moved only tens of thousands of refugees out of 1.5 million. The Lebanon Support collective documented how aid flows were channeled through sectarian political structures, reinforcing rather than challenging the patronage system.\n\nThe IMF programme remained unimplemented as of 2024, with the Lebanese parliament failing to pass required legislation on capital controls, bank restructuring, or public financial management reform. The Beirut port explosion killed over 200 people and caused $15 billion in damage, yet no accountability process was completed due to political obstruction.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Refugee crises in fragile states can accelerate pre-existing structural vulnerabilities rather than cause them, but the interaction compounds both problems\n- Cash transfer programmes lose effectiveness during hyperinflation and currency collapse without indexing mechanisms\n- Sectarian and patronage-based political systems are structurally resistant to reform even under extreme crisis conditions\n- The absence of formal refugee status frameworks pushes populations into exploitative informal arrangements\n- International financial support conditioned on reform is ineffective when domestic political will for reform is absent\n- Host community support is essential to prevent scapegoating of refugees for structural economic failures\n\n## References\n\n1.
