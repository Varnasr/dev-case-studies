  "content": "## Background\n\nBolivia sits atop South America's second-largest natural gas reserves, but for decades the population saw little benefit from extraction. The neoliberal reforms of the 1990s under President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada privatized the state hydrocarbons company YPFB (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos) and transferred gas field operations to multinational corporations — primarily Petrobras (Brazil), Repsol (Spain), and Total (France) — under contracts that left Bolivia with only 18% of production value.\n\nThe perception that Bolivia's gas wealth was being exported while the majority of the population (approximately 63% indigenous) remained impoverished generated intense popular resistance. The \"Gas Wars\" of 2003 — mass protests demanding nationalization and a constituent assembly — led to the ousting of President Sánchez de Lozada (who fled to the United States) and the deaths of over 60 protesters. His successor, Carlos Mesa, was also forced to resign in 2005 amid continued protests.\n\nEvo Morales, leader of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) and the country's first indigenous president, was elected in December 2005 with 54% of the vote — the largest margin in Bolivian democratic history — on a platform of gas nationalization and indigenous rights.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nOn May 1, 2006 — International Workers' Day — Morales issued Decreto Supremo 28701, nationalizing Bolivia's hydrocarbons. Military units were sent to occupy gas fields in a symbolic show of sovereignty. The decree required all foreign companies to transfer majority ownership (50% + 1) of their Bolivian operations to YPFB within 180 days and mandated renegotiation of all contracts to increase the state's share of production value.\n\nThe renegotiated contracts dramatically increased Bolivia's take: the effective state share rose from 18% to approximately 55–70% of production value, depending on the field and contract. Combined with rising global gas prices, state hydrocarbon revenues tripled from approximately $600 million in 2005 to over $1.8 billion annually by 2008–2013.\n\nThese revenues funded an expansion of social programs. The Bono Juancito Pinto (2006) provided an annual stipend of Bs 200 to all public school students to promote attendance and reduce dropout. The Bono Juana Azurduy (2009) provided cash transfers to pregnant women and mothers of young children conditional on health check-ups. Most significantly, the Renta Dignidad (2008) expanded the existing Bonosol into a universal non-contributory pension paying Bs 250 per month (approximately $36) to all Bolivians over age 60 — one of Latin America's most comprehensive universal pension programs.\n\nThe government also invested heavily in infrastructure: roads, hospitals, schools, and the Mi Teleférico urban cable car system in La Paz/El Alto (the world's longest urban aerial cable car network). Public investment as a share of GDP reached approximately 15%, among the highest in the region.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe macroeconomic results were impressive. Bolivia's GDP growth averaged 4.9% per year between 2006 and 2019, compared to approximately 3.5% for Latin America overall. Inflation remained moderate, international reserves rose from $1.7 billion in 2005 to $15.1 billion in 2014, and the fiscal balance was in surplus for most of the period.\n\nPoverty fell dramatically: from approximately 60% in 2006 to 35% in 2019 (using the national poverty line), and extreme poverty fell from 38% to approximately 15%. The Gini coefficient declined from 0.60 to 0.42, one of the most significant inequality reductions in the region. Weisbrot, Ray, and Johnston (2009) at CEPR documented the early evidence of improved economic performance and social outcomes under the Morales administration.\n\nKaup (2010) in *Latin American Perspectives* analyzed the nationalization process, finding that Bolivia took a pragmatic approach — renegotiating contracts rather than expropriating companies — which maintained production levels and foreign investment in the sector while dramatically increasing state revenues. The approach avoided the production disruptions experienced in some other nationalizations.\n\nYañez et al. (2011) found that the Renta Dignidad universal pension significantly reduced elderly poverty and had spillover benefits for multigenerational households, as pension income was shared with family members. The Bono Juancito Pinto was associated with reduced school dropout rates, particularly in rural areas.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe fundamental structural challenge was the failure to diversify the economy beyond gas dependence. Gas revenues constituted approximately 45% of total government revenue and 50% of exports. When global gas prices fell after 2014, fiscal revenues declined sharply, forcing the government to draw down international reserves (from $15.1 billion in 2014 to approximately $6 billion by 2019) and run fiscal deficits to maintain social spending.\n\nGas reserves themselves were declining: proven reserves fell from 26.5 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 2005 to approximately 10.7 TCF by 2018, as insufficient investment in exploration failed to replace extracted gas. Brazil, Bolivia's main gas export customer, was developing its own pre-salt offshore reserves, threatening future export demand.\n\nDomestic gas consumption was heavily subsidized, creating fiscal drain and environmental contradictions. Critics argued that the Morales government had substituted gas dependency for the previous mineral dependency without building the productive capacity for sustained development beyond extractivism.\n\nThe political crisis of 2019 — when Morales was ousted amid disputed election results and allegations of fraud — interrupted the MAS development model. The conservative interim government (2019–2020) attempted to reverse some policies before MAS returned to power under Luis Arce in 2020, facing a much more constrained fiscal environment.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Resource nationalization can dramatically increase state revenues when implemented pragmatically (contract renegotiation rather than expropriation), maintaining production while increasing the state's share\n- Universal social transfers (pensions, school stipends) financed by resource revenues can achieve rapid poverty reduction, but their sustainability depends on continued resource income\n- Commodity revenue windfalls create an imperative for economic diversification; failure to diversify leaves countries vulnerable when prices fall or reserves deplete\n- Building international reserves during boom periods provides fiscal buffers but is not a substitute for structural economic transformation\n- Resource governance involves fundamental political choices about the distribution of extraction benefits between foreign companies, national elites, and the broader population\n\n## References\n\n1.
