  "content": "## Background\n\nZambia has experienced persistent poverty despite periods of significant economic growth, particularly during the copper price boom of the 2000s. In the early 2000s, approximately 70% of the population lived below the national poverty line, with extreme poverty concentrated in rural areas. HIV/AIDS had devastated the working-age population, creating large numbers of orphan-headed and elderly-headed households that lacked labour capacity to sustain themselves through agriculture or informal employment.\n\nZambia had no formal social protection system for the ultra-poor. Government social spending was largely channeled through in-kind programmes such as food distribution, agricultural input support, and fee waivers, which were fragmented, poorly targeted, and insufficient in coverage. The concept of regular cash transfers to the poorest households was unfamiliar in the Zambian policy context, and there was significant scepticism that cash transfers would be used productively by poor recipients.\n\nThe Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS), with technical and financial support from UNICEF Zambia and the German development agency GTZ (now GIZ), initiated a pilot social cash transfer (SCT) programme in Kalomo District in 2003. Kalomo was chosen for its high poverty rates, significant HIV/AIDS impact, and a receptive local administration.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Kalomo pilot targeted the most destitute 10% of households in the district, defined as those that were both ultra-poor (unable to meet basic food needs) and labour-constrained (having no able-bodied adult member or a very high dependency ratio). This dual targeting criterion reflected the programme's focus on households that could not benefit from growth or employment-based interventions. Community welfare assistance committees identified eligible households through a combination of community wealth ranking and proxy means testing.\n\nBeneficiary households received unconditional monthly cash transfers, initially around ZMW 30,000 (old currency, approximately $10) per month, adjusted for household size and composition. The transfers were modest but predictable, delivered bimonthly through pay points in local communities. No conditions were attached to the transfers, reflecting the view that the ultra-poor needed income support first and foremost, and that conditionality would impose unnecessary administrative and compliance burdens on the most vulnerable.\n\nThe pilot demonstrated sufficient promise that the government progressively expanded the programme, first to additional districts and then nationally. By 2017, the SCT had been rolled out to all 116 districts in Zambia. The programme transitioned from predominantly donor-financed to majority government-funded, with domestic financing covering the bulk of transfer costs by 2018. By 2020, the programme reached over 700,000 households.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe most rigorous evidence on the Zambia SCT comes from evaluations conducted by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) as part of the Transfer Project, a multi-country research initiative supported by UNICEF and FAO. Seidenfeld, Handa, and colleagues conducted randomized controlled trials in multiple districts, finding significant positive impacts across a range of outcomes.\n\nThe AIR evaluations found that beneficiary households increased food consumption by approximately 15-20%, reduced the number of meals skipped, and improved dietary diversity. Children's school enrollment and attendance increased, and there was a reduction in child labour. Notably, the evaluations found that households invested a portion of transfers in productive assets, including livestock and agricultural inputs, contradicting the assumption that the ultra-poor would consume all transfers immediately. Handa et al. (2018), published in *World Development*, presented evidence from the multi-country Transfer Project showing that Zambia's SCT, along with similar programmes in other African countries, generated positive multiplier effects in local economies.\n\nSeidenfeld and Handa (2016) also documented positive effects on women's empowerment, including increased control over household resources and reduced intimate partner violence among beneficiary households. The programme's unconditional design was validated by the finding that households used transfers productively without the need for costly conditionality enforcement.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nDespite positive evaluation results, the programme has faced persistent challenges. Transfer amounts remain low relative to the poverty gap, providing income support but generally insufficient to lift households out of poverty. Payment delivery has been plagued by delays, with some beneficiaries waiting months for their transfers, undermining the predictability that is essential for effective social protection.\n\nTargeting remains contentious. The focus on labour-constrained ultra-poor households means that the programme does not reach the \"working poor\" who constitute a much larger share of the impoverished population. Coverage at approximately 700,000 households represents only a fraction of Zambia's poor. Some political actors have pushed for broader coverage, which would dilute the pro-poor targeting. Fiscal sustainability concerns persist, particularly given Zambia's debt crisis (the country defaulted on its sovereign debt in 2020), which has constrained public spending across all sectors.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Targeting the ultra-poor and labour-constrained can effectively reach households that cannot benefit from growth or employment programmes, but it limits coverage of the broader poor population.\n- Unconditional cash transfers can generate productive investment even among the poorest households, supporting the case against mandatory conditionality in extreme poverty contexts.\n- Gradual scale-up from small pilots allows for learning, evidence accumulation, and institutional capacity building before national expansion.\n- Transitioning from donor to domestic financing is critical for sustainability but vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks and fiscal pressures.\n- Predictable, regular transfers are more effective than erratic payments; delivery infrastructure and payment systems require sustained investment.\n\n## References\n\n- Seidenfeld, D., Handa, S., Tembo, G., Michelo, S., Harland Scott, C., & Prencipe, L.
