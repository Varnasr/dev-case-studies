  "content": "## Background\n\nChile is the world's largest copper producer, and copper has historically accounted for approximately 50% of export revenues and a significant share of government income through CODELCO (the state copper company) profits and mining royalties. This dependence exposed Chile to extreme fiscal volatility: when copper prices boomed, government revenues surged, creating pressures for procyclical spending; when prices collapsed, revenues dried up, forcing painful austerity.\n\nThe \"resource curse\" — the paradox that resource-rich countries often experience slower growth, higher inequality, and worse governance than resource-poor peers — was well-documented across Latin America and Africa. Chile's challenge was to harness copper wealth for development while avoiding the boom-bust cycles that destabilized other commodity exporters.\n\nThe initial institutional response was the Copper Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilización del Cobre), established in 1985 during the Pinochet era. This fund saved revenue when copper prices exceeded a reference price and drew down savings when prices fell below it. While rudimentary, it established the principle of saving commodity windfalls.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe transformative reform came in 2001 when Finance Minister Nicolás Eyzaguirre introduced the structural balance rule under President Lagos. This framework committed the government to targeting a structural (cyclically-adjusted) fiscal balance — originally a surplus of 1% of GDP — calculated by adjusting actual revenues for the copper price cycle and the output gap. When actual copper prices exceeded the estimated long-run trend price, excess revenues were saved; when prices fell below trend, the government could spend from savings.\n\nCritically, the long-run copper price was not set by politicians but by an independent panel of experts (Comité Consultivo del Precio de Referencia del Cobre), insulating the estimate from political pressure to assume higher prices and spend more. A separate panel estimated potential GDP for the output gap calculation.\n\nThe framework was legislated in the 2006 Fiscal Responsibility Law, which also established two sovereign wealth funds: the Fondo de Estabilización Económica y Social (ESSF), designed for macroeconomic stabilization, and the Fondo de Reserva de Pensiones (PRF), dedicated to future pension liabilities. Funds were invested internationally in diversified portfolios, managed by the Central Bank.\n\nDuring the copper price boom of 2006–2008, Chile accumulated massive savings. The ESSF reached approximately $20 billion and the PRF approximately $4 billion, while the government ran fiscal surpluses and reduced public debt to among the lowest levels in the region.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nFrankel (2011) in the American Economic Review argued that Chile's fiscal institutions represented the gold standard for counter-cyclical commodity management, identifying the independent expert panels as the critical innovation that prevented political manipulation of price assumptions. He contrasted Chile's fiscal prudence with the procyclical spending observed in most other commodity-exporting developing countries.\n\nMarcel (2013), who as Budget Director implemented the structural balance rule, documented how the framework transformed Chile's fiscal management: fiscal policy became genuinely counter-cyclical for the first time, with the government saving during booms and spending during downturns. Chile's sovereign risk ratings improved to the highest in Latin America (A+ from S&P).\n\nThe 2009 global financial crisis provided the definitive test. While other Latin American countries faced severe fiscal constraints, Chile deployed approximately $4 billion from the ESSF in a counter-cyclical stimulus package — including temporary cash transfers, infrastructure spending, and tax cuts. GDP contracted only 1% in 2009 and rebounded 5.8% in 2010, significantly outperforming regional peers. Cespedes and Velasco (2014) confirmed that the fiscal stimulus was effective in cushioning the recession.\n\nThe framework also contributed to macroeconomic stability more broadly. Chile maintained low inflation, manageable debt levels, and strong credit ratings throughout the commodity super-cycle, avoiding the Dutch disease effects (exchange rate appreciation undermining non-commodity exports) that affected other resource exporters.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe structural balance target was progressively relaxed over time: from 1% surplus under Lagos to 0.5% under Bachelet I to 0% under Piñera, and subsequently to deficits under Bachelet II and Piñera II. ESSF balances fell from their 2008 peak as successive governments drew on savings to finance spending commitments. By 2020, the ESSF had declined to approximately $4 billion, raising concerns about the erosion of fiscal buffers.\n\nCritics argued that Chile's fiscal prudence came at the cost of under-investment in public services. Education, healthcare, and infrastructure spending remained below OECD averages, contributing to the social discontent that erupted in the October 2019 estallido social (social explosion). The resource curse may have been avoided at the macroeconomic level, but the fruits of copper wealth were unevenly distributed.\n\nVelasco (2023) noted that the framework's credibility depended on political commitment, which could not be permanently legislated. As the original architects departed and political pressures mounted, adherence to fiscal discipline weakened — demonstrating that institutional rules require ongoing political support.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Independent expert panels for commodity price assumptions are a critical institutional innovation that insulates fiscal policy from political optimism\n- Structural balance rules that explicitly adjust for commodity cycles enable genuine counter-cyclical fiscal policy in resource-dependent economies\n- Sovereign wealth funds provide fiscal buffers that prove their value during crises, but their preservation requires sustained political discipline\n- Fiscal prudence must be complemented by adequate public investment in services and human capital to maintain social legitimacy\n- Institutional rules can erode over time through gradual relaxation of targets, requiring vigilance against incremental departures from fiscal discipline\n\n## References\n\n1.
