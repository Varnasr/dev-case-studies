  "content": "## Background\n\nBy the early 2000s, the HIV/AIDS pandemic had reached catastrophic proportions in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 25 million Africans were living with HIV, and AIDS was the leading cause of death on the continent. In the hardest-hit countries, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe, adult prevalence exceeded 20%, decimating the working-age population and creating millions of orphans. Life expectancy in several Southern African countries had dropped below 40 years, reversing decades of progress.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) had transformed HIV from a death sentence to a manageable chronic condition in wealthy countries, but fewer than 50,000 people in all of Sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment in 2002. The drugs remained prohibitively expensive, health infrastructure was inadequate, and the prevailing view among some global health experts was that ART delivery in resource-limited settings was not feasible.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nOn January 28, 2003, President George W. Bush announced PEPFAR in his State of the Union address, committing $15 billion over five years to combat HIV/AIDS, making it the largest international health initiative by a single nation ever. The program initially focused on 15 countries with the highest HIV burden: Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia.\n\nPEPFAR's approach combined treatment, prevention, and care. The treatment component rapidly scaled up ART delivery, establishing clinics, training health workers, and negotiating reduced drug prices (from $10,000+ to under $100 per patient per year through generic procurement). Prevention programs included abstinence, be faithful, and condom use (the \"ABC\" approach), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), and testing and counseling.\n\nThe program was reauthorized in 2008 with $48 billion over five years and again in 2013 and 2018. The DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) initiative, launched in 2015, specifically targeted adolescent girls and young women in 15 high-burden countries, recognizing that this population accounted for a disproportionate share of new infections.\n\nPEPFAR invested heavily in laboratory infrastructure, supply chain systems, and health information systems that served broader health system functions beyond HIV alone. The program's implementing partners included USAID, CDC, the Department of Defense, Peace Corps, and numerous international and local NGOs.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nBendavid and Bhattacharya (2009), published in *Annals of Internal Medicine*, conducted the most rigorous quantitative assessment of PEPFAR's population-level impact. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing PEPFAR focus countries with non-focus countries over 2004–2007, they estimated that PEPFAR was associated with a 10.5% reduction in all-cause mortality in focus countries, representing approximately 1.2 million deaths averted during the study period alone.\n\nFeeney and Gostin (2011) documented PEPFAR's role in transforming the global HIV response from palliative care to treatment scale-up. By 2023, PEPFAR supported antiretroviral treatment for over 20 million people and had enabled 5.5 million babies to be born HIV-free through PMTCT programs. New HIV infections in PEPFAR focus countries declined significantly, and AIDS-related deaths fell from their peak.\n\nThe program's investment in health systems produced broader benefits. Laboratory networks built for HIV testing and monitoring were repurposed for TB diagnosis, COVID-19 testing, and other diseases. Supply chain systems for antiretroviral drugs improved distribution of other essential medicines. Health worker training programs strengthened the overall health workforce.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nPEPFAR's early prevention strategy, particularly the emphasis on abstinence and faithfulness, was criticized as ideologically driven and inadequate. The requirement that one-third of prevention funding be spent on abstinence-until-marriage programs (mandated in the 2003 legislation) was seen as undermining evidence-based prevention, particularly condom promotion and harm reduction for key populations. This earmark was removed in the 2008 reauthorization.\n\nMoss (2008) raised concerns about the sustainability and country ownership dimensions of PEPFAR. The program operated largely through US-based implementing partners and parallel systems rather than strengthening national health systems and government capacity. This created dependency risks and raised questions about what would happen if US funding declined.\n\nThe program's focus on vertical HIV service delivery was criticized for drawing health workers and resources away from other health priorities, potentially weakening primary care systems. This \"brain drain\" within countries, from government clinics to better-funded PEPFAR programs, was documented in several countries.\n\nPolitical uncertainty has been a persistent challenge. The program has faced periodic reauthorization debates in Congress, and funding levels have fluctuated with changing political priorities. In 2023–2024, reauthorization was delayed due to domestic political disputes, creating uncertainty for treatment programs serving millions of people.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Large-scale ART delivery in resource-limited settings is feasible and saves lives, contradicting earlier skepticism\n- Health infrastructure investments for specific diseases can generate broader health system benefits\n- Ideological constraints on prevention programming can undermine public health effectiveness\n- Sustainability requires systematic transition from parallel delivery systems to integrated national health systems\n- Bilateral programs create dependency risks when host country ownership and domestic financing are not prioritized\n\n## References\n\n1.
