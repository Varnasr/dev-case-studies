  "content": "## Background\n\nIn the mid-20th century, rapid population growth in Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa raised fears of widespread famine. Paul Ehrlich's *The Population Bomb* (1968) predicted mass starvation. Meanwhile, agronomist Norman Borlaug, working at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, developed semi-dwarf, disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat varieties. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), established in the Philippines in 1960, pursued parallel work on rice. Together, these efforts launched what became known as the Green Revolution.\n\nPrior to these innovations, cereal yields in developing countries had stagnated. India experienced severe food crises in the mid-1960s and was heavily dependent on US food aid under PL-480. The prospect of feeding growing populations with existing agricultural technology appeared increasingly untenable.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe Green Revolution centered on a package of technologies: high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice, synthetic fertilizers, chemical pesticides, irrigation infrastructure, and mechanization. Borlaug's semi-dwarf wheat varieties were introduced to India and Pakistan in the mid-1960s, with dramatic results. India's wheat production jumped from 12.3 million tonnes in 1965 to 20.1 million tonnes by 1970. IRRI's IR8 rice variety, released in 1966, similarly transformed rice production across Southeast Asia.\n\nGovernments played a critical role through subsidized inputs, extension services, and infrastructure investment. India's strategy under the leadership of M.S. Swaminathan combined HYV adoption with investments in irrigation, particularly in Punjab and Haryana. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), established in 1971, provided an institutional framework for coordinating global agricultural research across 15 international centers.\n\nThe model was replicated across Asia: Indonesia achieved rice self-sufficiency by 1984, and China's rice yields more than doubled between 1960 and 1990. Latin American countries, particularly Mexico and Brazil, also adopted HYVs with significant production gains.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nEvenson and Gollin's comprehensive review in *Science* (2003) estimated that Green Revolution crop varieties were responsible for significant yield gains across the developing world. They found that without these varieties, crop production in developing countries would have been 19.5–23.5% lower, food prices would have been 35–66% higher, and calorie consumption among the poorest populations would have declined substantially.\n\nHazell (2009) estimated that cereal production in developing countries more than doubled between 1960 and 2000, from 420 million tonnes to over 1 billion tonnes, while the area under cultivation increased by only 25%. This productivity gain is widely credited with averting the predicted Malthusian crisis and saving an estimated one billion people from famine.\n\nPoverty rates in Asia declined dramatically during this period. India's poverty headcount fell from approximately 60% in the 1960s to 36% by 1993. Studies have demonstrated that agricultural growth driven by the Green Revolution was a primary contributor to poverty reduction, particularly in South Asia.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe Green Revolution generated significant environmental costs. Intensive irrigation led to groundwater depletion and waterlogging, particularly in India's Punjab region. Heavy pesticide and fertilizer use caused soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. The focus on monoculture reduced crop genetic diversity, increasing vulnerability to pests and disease.\n\nEquity concerns were also substantial. Larger, wealthier farmers benefited disproportionately, as they could afford the complementary inputs (fertilizer, irrigation, credit). Shiva (1991) argued that the Green Revolution marginalized smallholders and traditional farming systems. Sub-Saharan Africa was largely bypassed, as the technologies were less suited to the continent's diverse agro-ecological conditions and fragmented institutional landscape.\n\nEnvironmental critics have also pointed to the substantial greenhouse gas emissions associated with synthetic fertilizer production and the long-term sustainability challenges of intensive monoculture systems.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Technology alone is insufficient; institutional support, infrastructure, and policy frameworks are essential for adoption at scale\n- Productivity gains can avert famine and reduce poverty, but distributional effects must be actively managed\n- Environmental sustainability must be integrated into agricultural intensification strategies from the outset\n- Success in one region does not guarantee replicability elsewhere without adaptation to local conditions\n- Long-term investment in international agricultural research institutions (CGIAR system) yielded enormous returns\n\n## References\n\n1.
