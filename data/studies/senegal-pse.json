  "content": "## Background\n\nSenegal has long been considered one of West Africa's most stable democracies, with a tradition of peaceful power transfers and strong civil society. However, despite this political stability, economic performance was disappointing for decades. GDP growth averaged around 3-4% per year through the 2000s, barely exceeding population growth and insufficient to significantly reduce poverty. By 2011, approximately 47% of the population lived below the national poverty line, and Senegal ranked 163rd out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index.\n\nThe economy faced structural constraints common to many West African countries: a narrow export base concentrated in fish, groundnuts, and phosphates; an oversized informal sector; inadequate infrastructure, particularly in energy; chronic power shortages; and a large and unproductive public sector. Dakar, home to roughly a quarter of the national population, suffered from severe congestion, inadequate housing, and strained services.\n\nPresident Macky Sall, who took office in 2012, commissioned a comprehensive development strategy with technical assistance from McKinsey & Company and other international advisors. The resulting Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE) was adopted in February 2014 as the country's overarching long-term development framework.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe PSE is structured around three pillars: structural transformation of the economy and growth; human capital, social protection, and sustainable development; and governance, institutions, peace, and security. The plan identified priority sectors for accelerated investment, including agriculture, tourism, mining, digital economy, housing, and logistics. It set an ambitious target of sustained GDP growth of 7% or above to achieve emerging economy status by 2035.\n\nThe most visible PSE interventions have been in infrastructure. The Diamniadio urban pole, located approximately 30 kilometers from central Dakar, was conceived as a new administrative and industrial hub to decongest the capital. Major facilities include a conference centre, industrial zone, technology park, and a new university. The Blaise Diagne International Airport (AIBD), which opened in 2017, replaced the outdated Leopald Sedar Senghor airport. The Train Express Regional (TER), a regional express train connecting Dakar to the new airport via Diamniadio, opened in 2022. A Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Dakar was under construction to provide mass transit along the city's most congested corridor.\n\nIn agriculture, the PSE promoted agro-industrial projects, irrigation development in the Senegal River valley, and value chain upgrading for groundnuts, rice, and horticulture. Energy sector reforms attracted private investment in solar and gas-powered generation, substantially reducing the chronic power shortages that had constrained economic activity.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe macroeconomic results of the PSE's early years were encouraging. GDP growth accelerated from approximately 3.5% per year in 2010-2013 to an average of about 6.5% per year from 2014 to 2019, making Senegal one of the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Inflation remained low, and the business climate improved according to World Bank Doing Business indicators.\n\nThe IMF's 2019 Article IV consultation report noted that the acceleration in growth was driven by increased public investment, improved agricultural performance, and expanding services sectors. Foreign direct investment increased, attracted by the new airport, improved energy supply, and the prospect of oil and gas production from discoveries in the offshore Sangomar and Greater Tortue Ahmeyim fields.\n\nHowever, the growth acceleration raised questions about inclusiveness and sustainability. Poverty reduction lagged behind GDP growth, with the poverty headcount declining only modestly. Job creation in the formal sector was insufficient to absorb the growing youth population, and the informal economy continued to employ the majority of workers. The benefits of infrastructure investments were concentrated in Dakar and its surroundings, with rural areas seeing less improvement.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe most significant concern has been fiscal sustainability. Public debt rose from approximately 47% of GDP in 2014 to 64% by 2019, driven by heavy infrastructure investment financed partly through non-concessional borrowing. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, debt rose further to over 70% of GDP. Debt service costs consumed an increasing share of government revenue, reducing fiscal space for social spending.\n\nCritics have questioned the PSE's prioritization of large-scale infrastructure \"flagship projects\" over investments in human capital, primary healthcare, and basic services for the rural poor. The McKinsey-influenced approach of identifying growth sectors and promoting industrial platforms has been criticized as insufficiently grounded in Senegal's comparative advantages and institutional realities. The political crisis of 2023-2024, involving the postponement of presidential elections and civil unrest, raised broader governance concerns that could undermine investor confidence and the implementation of long-term development plans.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Comprehensive development strategies can accelerate growth if backed by sustained political commitment and coherent implementation, but growth alone does not guarantee inclusive development.\n- Large-scale infrastructure investments can catalyze economic activity but must be financed sustainably to avoid debt distress.\n- New city and industrial zone developments (like Diamniadio) require time to achieve critical mass and may not deliver expected returns in the short term.\n- Oil and gas discoveries create opportunities but also risks of Dutch Disease, governance challenges, and unrealistic expectations.\n- Development plans must balance flagship projects with investments in basic services, human capital, and rural development to ensure broad-based benefits.\n\n## References\n\n- Republic of Senegal.
