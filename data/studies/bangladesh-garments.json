This transformation turned Bangladesh into the world's second-largest garment exporter after China and became the single most important driver of the country's poverty reduction, cutting the national poverty rate from 49% in 2000 to under 19% by 2022. Yet the model came at enormous human cost: the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse killed 1,134 workers and exposed systemic safety failures, wage suppression, and labor rights violations embedded in the industry's competitive advantage. Post-Rana Plaza reforms, particularly the Accord on Fire and Building Safety, demonstrated that international pressure could improve factory conditions without destroying the industry — though wages remain controversially low. Verdict: Bangladesh's garment miracle is real but incomplete; it proves that export-led industrialization can empower women and reduce poverty at scale, but only if accompanied by robust labor protections and upward wage mobility.\n\n---\n\n## Context & Background\n\nIn 1980, Bangladesh was one of the poorest countries on Earth. Per capita income hovered around $300 (in current USD), the economy was overwhelmingly agricultural, and the country was widely dismissed — Henry Kissinger's infamous \"bottomless basket\" quip from 1974 still haunted its reputation. The garment industry barely existed: total RMG exports in 1983 were just $31.6 million.\n\nThe story of how this changed begins with an unlikely partnership. In 1978, the Desh Garment Company sent 130 Bangladeshi workers to Daewoo's factory in South Korea for training in garment production. This single act of technology and knowledge transfer — later documented by economists Alice Amsden and others — seeded an entire industry. Within a decade, former Desh employees had started 50+ garment factories across Dhaka and Chittagong.\n\nThree structural factors accelerated growth. First, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), the global quota system governing textile trade from 1974 to 2004, paradoxically helped Bangladesh. Because quotas constrained established exporters like South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, global buyers actively sought new sourcing countries with unused quota allocations. Bangladesh, with rock-bottom labor costs and available quota, became an attractive alternative.\n\nSecond, Bangladesh offered the lowest labor costs in the world for garment production. In the early 2000s, the minimum wage for garment workers was approximately $20-25 per month — a fraction of China's rates and roughly half of Vietnam's and Cambodia's. This wage advantage was not accidental; it reflected a deliberate (if implicit) policy choice: the government kept minimum wages low, limited unionization, and provided tax holidays and duty-free import privileges for fabric through bonded warehouse facilities.\n\nThird, demographic forces created a massive pool of young women willing to migrate from rural areas to Dhaka and Chittagong for factory work. Bangladesh's fertility rate was declining rapidly (from 6.4 children per woman in 1975 to 3.0 by 2000), partly due to the country's successful family planning programs. This created a demographic window: millions of young women with fewer childcare obligations and strong economic motivation.\n\nBy 2004, the year the MFA expired, Bangladesh's garment exports had reached $5.7 billion. The critical question was whether the industry would survive without quota protection. Many economists predicted it would not — that Bangladesh would lose market share to China, which had been constrained by quotas. The predictions proved spectacularly wrong.\n\n---\n\n## The Intervention\n\nBangladesh's garment industry growth was not the result of a single policy intervention but rather a layered set of government decisions, international trade arrangements, and private sector actions spanning four decades.\n\n**Government industrial policy (1980s-present):** The government established Export Processing Zones (EPZs) beginning in 1983 in Chittagong, offering 10-year tax holidays, duty-free import of machinery and raw materials, and streamlined customs. Bonded warehouse facilities allowed garment factories outside EPZs to import fabric duty-free, provided the finished goods were exported. The back-to-back letter of credit system, introduced in the early 1990s, allowed Bangladeshi manufacturers with limited capital to use buyer orders as collateral for financing fabric purchases — a critical financial innovation that lowered barriers to entry.\n\n**MFA quota phase (1974-2004):** The quota system provided Bangladesh with guaranteed market access to the US and EU. When the MFA ended on January 1, 2005, many feared catastrophe. Instead, Bangladesh's exports grew from $5.7 billion in 2004 to $12.5 billion by 2009. The industry had built sufficient scale, buyer relationships, and efficiency to compete on its own.\n\n**Post-Rana Plaza safety reforms (2013-present):** The collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building on April 24, 2013, killing 1,134 workers and injuring over 2,500, triggered the most significant intervention in the industry's history. Within weeks, over 200 international brands signed the legally binding Accord on Fire and Building Safety, committing to independent factory inspections, remediation funding, and worker complaint mechanisms. A parallel initiative, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety (led primarily by North American retailers like Walmart and Gap), covered an additional 700 factories. The Accord inspected 1,600+ factories, identified over 150,000 safety hazards, and by 2018 reported that 84% of identified issues had been remediated.\n\n**Minimum wage revisions:** The garment minimum wage has been revised multiple times: from Tk 1,662.50/month in 2006 to Tk 3,000 in 2010, Tk 5,300 in 2013 (immediately after Rana Plaza), Tk 8,000 in 2018, and Tk 12,500 ($113) in December 2023. Each revision followed worker protests and, frequently, violence.\n\n**Scale and scope:** By 2023, there were approximately 3,500 registered garment factories in Bangladesh. The sector accounted for 84% of total export earnings and employed an estimated 4 million workers directly, with millions more in ancillary industries. The EU and US remained the dominant markets, absorbing roughly 60% and 18% of exports respectively.\n\n---\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe theory of change underlying Bangladesh's garment-led development strategy operates through several interlinked channels.\n\n**Employment creation for low-skilled workers, especially women:** The garment industry's primary development impact has been providing formal (or semi-formal) wage employment to millions of women who would otherwise have been confined to subsistence agriculture, domestic work, or the informal sector. Research by Rachel Heath and A. Mushfiq Mobarak (2015) found that garment factory exposure increased the probability of women's employment by 6.4 percentage points and significantly delayed marriage and childbearing for young women living near factories.\n\n**Foreign exchange and macroeconomic stability:** Garment exports provided a reliable and growing source of foreign exchange, reducing Bangladesh's dependence on aid and stabilizing the balance of payments. Combined with remittances (which grew simultaneously), garment exports gave Bangladesh the macroeconomic room to invest in health, education, and infrastructure.\n\n**Technology transfer and industrial learning:** The initial Desh-Daewoo collaboration established a pattern. Bangladeshi firms learned production management, quality control, and compliance standards from international buyers. Over time, some firms moved up the value chain from simple cut-make-trim (CMT) operations to full-package production, including fabric sourcing, design, and logistics.\n\n**Women's empowerment through income:** The pathway from factory employment to women's empowerment was hypothesized to work through several mechanisms: independent income increasing women's bargaining power within households, exposure to urban life expanding social networks and aspirations, and delayed marriage providing more time for education. Evidence on these channels is mixed — household bargaining power gains are documented but modest, and many women report that male family members control their wages.\n\n**Post-Rana Plaza safety mechanism:** The Accord's theory of change was that legally binding commitments from brands, coupled with transparent inspection data and worker complaint mechanisms, would create accountability that voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives had failed to deliver. The binding nature was critical — brands faced legal liability in their home countries if they failed to ensure remediation.\n\n---\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe evidence on Bangladesh's garment sector tells a story of remarkable aggregate success combined with persistent individual-level hardship.\n\n**Macro-level transformation:** Bangladesh's GDP per capita rose from $407 in 2000 to $2,688 by 2022 (current USD, World Bank). The poverty headcount ratio fell from 48.9% in 2000 to 18.7% in 2022 (national poverty line). Life expectancy increased from 65.3 years in 2000 to 72.4 years in 2022, surpassing India's 70.8 years. While the garment sector was not the sole driver of these gains — microcredit, remittances, agricultural improvements, and public health investments all contributed — economists broadly agree it was the most important single factor.\n\n**Women's employment and social outcomes:** Heath and Mobarak's 2015 study in the *Journal of Political Economy* — one of the most rigorous pieces of evidence — found that garment factory access led to a 28% increase in the likelihood of girls aged 12-18 being enrolled in school, and delayed marriage by 1.5 years on average. These are large effects. However, the study focused on communities near new factories; for women already employed, the picture is more complex. A 2019 survey by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) found that 72% of female garment workers reported that their income had improved their status within their families, but only 38% reported having full control over their own earnings.\n\n**Safety reform outcomes:** The Accord (later the International Accord) inspected 1,688 factories and identified 154,689 safety hazards by 2021. Of these, 92% were reported as remediated by 2023. Fire-related deaths in Accord-covered factories dropped from 112 in 2012 (the year before Rana Plaza) to zero in most subsequent years. Structural safety improved markedly: 38 factories were closed or partially closed due to imminent structural danger, and over 150 factories invested in major structural retrofits. The Alliance (which ended in 2018) reported similar but somewhat less impressive numbers, with about 80% remediation across its 700 factories.\n\n**Comparative performance:** After the MFA ended in 2005, Cambodia lost market share and saw slower export growth. Vietnam gained share but through a more capital-intensive model with higher wages. Bangladesh's ability to compete post-MFA without the race-to-the-bottom collapse that critics predicted is significant. However, its export basket remains heavily concentrated — 84% of exports are garments — creating vulnerability.\n\n**Wage trends (the uncomfortable reality):** Despite massive industry growth, real wages for garment workers grew slowly. The 2023 minimum wage of Tk 12,500/month ($113) still places Bangladeshi garment workers among the lowest-paid in the world. Adjusted for inflation, the 2023 wage is only about 40% higher in real terms than the 2006 minimum wage. The Asia Floor Wage Alliance estimated in 2022 that a living wage for Dhaka would be approximately Tk 23,000-25,000/month — roughly double the then-prevailing minimum wage. Worker protests demanding higher wages have been met with mass firings, police violence, and factory closures.\n\n---\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**Structural safety was ignored for decades.** The Rana Plaza disaster did not come from nowhere. Between 2005 and 2013, at least 1,800 garment workers died in factory fires and building collapses, according to the Clean Clothes Campaign. The Tazreen Fashion factory fire in November 2012 killed 112 workers just five months before Rana Plaza. Regulatory failure was near-total: the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), Dhaka's building authority, had only 40 engineers to inspect buildings in a city of 20 million. Factory building inspections were perfunctory, corrupt, or nonexistent.\n\n**Wage suppression as competitive strategy.** The government's implicit bargain — low wages in exchange for jobs — has kept millions of workers in or near poverty despite formal employment. The garment sector's contribution to GDP growth has not translated into proportional gains for workers. Factory owners, organized through the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), have consistently lobbied against minimum wage increases, arguing they would make Bangladesh uncompetitive. The gap between worker productivity gains and wage gains has widened: labor productivity in the sector increased an estimated 60% between 2010 and 2020, while real wages grew approximately 25%.\n\n**Union suppression and labor rights violations.** Fewer than 5% of garment factories had registered trade unions as of 2022. Workers who attempted to organize faced termination, blacklisting, and physical intimidation. The Bangladesh Labor Act of 2006 (amended in 2013 and 2018) requires 30% of a factory's workforce to sign a petition to form a union — an impossibly high threshold in a context where organizers are routinely fired. The IndustriALL Global Union documented over 1,200 cases of anti-union discrimination between 2013 and 2020.\n\n**Limited value chain upgrading.** Despite 40 years of industry growth, Bangladesh remains concentrated in the lowest-value segments of the garment value chain. The country imports roughly 40% of its fabric (primarily from China and India), capturing only the cut-make-trim (CMT) margin. Attempts to develop a domestic textile sector have had limited success outside knitwear. The average unit price of Bangladeshi garment exports — approximately $3.50 per piece — is among the lowest in the world, compared to $5.50 for Vietnam and $8.00 for China.\n\n**Gender empowerment gains are shallow.** While women constitute 80% of the workforce, they hold fewer than 5% of supervisory positions. Sexual harassment remains pervasive — a 2019 ActionAid survey found that 80% of female garment workers reported experiencing or witnessing sexual harassment. The industry has created employment for women but has not fundamentally altered gender hierarchies within factories or households.\n\n**Environmental degradation.** The industry is a major polluter. Dhaka's tanneries (relocated in 2017 from Hazaribagh to Savar after decades of delay) had been dumping 22,000 cubic meters of untreated toxic waste daily into the Buriganga River. Textile dyeing and washing operations consume enormous quantities of water and discharge chemical effluents. While some factories have adopted green building standards (Bangladesh has more LEED-certified green garment factories than any other country, with 200+ certified by 2023), these represent a small fraction of the industry.\n\n---\n\n## Lessons for Policymakers\n\n**1. Export-led industrialization can work for the poorest countries, but it requires active management.** Bangladesh's garment success was not pure laissez-faire. Bonded warehouses, back-to-back LCs, EPZs, and trade preferences all played roles. The lesson is that industrial policy does not require picking specific firms — it requires creating the enabling conditions (trade facilitation, customs efficiency, infrastructure) for competitive industries to emerge.\n\n**2. Low wages are a starting point, not a strategy.** Bangladesh's failure to ensure that wages kept pace with productivity growth and industry profits is the sector's greatest policy failure. Countries entering export manufacturing should build in automatic minimum wage adjustment mechanisms (indexed to inflation and productivity) from the start, rather than relying on periodic political battles.\n\n**3. Binding international agreements work better than voluntary CSR.** The Accord's success relative to pre-Rana Plaza voluntary initiatives is one of the clearest natural experiments in labor standards enforcement. The key difference was legal enforceability: brands faced litigation risk in European courts. Voluntary codes of conduct, by contrast, had been in place for two decades with minimal impact on safety outcomes.\n\n**4. Women's employment is necessary but not sufficient for empowerment.** Jobs for women change social dynamics — delayed marriage, school enrollment, and geographic mobility are real gains. But without workplace protections, anti-harassment enforcement, pathways to promotion, and women's control over their own earnings, employment can create new forms of exploitation while dismantling old ones.\n\n**5. Diversification must be planned before it becomes urgent.** Bangladesh's 84% export concentration in garments is a macroeconomic vulnerability. The loss of EU Everything But Arms (EBA) trade preferences upon LDC graduation (expected around 2026-2029) could impose tariffs of 9-12% on garment exports to the EU, potentially costing $3-5 billion annually. Diversification into IT services, pharmaceuticals, and light engineering has been discussed for decades but remains underdeveloped.\n\n---\n\n## Key Data Table\n\n| Indicator | Value | Year | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Total RMG exports | $46.99 billion | 2022-23 | BGMEA |\n| Share of total exports | 84.6% | 2022-23 | Bangladesh Export Promotion Bureau |\n| Number of RMG factories | ~3,500 | 2023 | BGMEA |\n| Total employment | ~4 million | 2023 | BGMEA estimate |\n| Female share of workforce | ~58-80% (declining from historical 80%) | 2023 | ILO / CPD |\n| Minimum wage (garment sector) | Tk 12,500/month (~$113) | Dec 2023 | Government gazette |\n| Rana Plaza death toll | 1,134 killed, 2,500+ injured | April 2013 | ILO |\n| Accord safety hazards identified | 154,689 | 2021 | International Accord |\n| Accord remediation rate | 92% | 2023 | International Accord |\n| GDP per capita | $2,688 | 2022 | World Bank |\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n1.

If you were advising the Bangladesh government, how would you design a minimum wage policy that balances competitiveness with worker welfare? What evidence would you use to determine the \"right\" wage level?\n\n2. **Binding vs. voluntary standards:** The Accord on Fire and Building Safety was effective partly because it was legally binding. Should this model be extended to wages and working hours, or would binding international wage agreements drive production to even lower-cost countries? What are the limits of using international legal mechanisms to enforce labor standards?\n\n3. **Gender and industrialization:** The garment industry brought millions of Bangladeshi women into the formal labor force but has not delivered equal pay, workplace safety from harassment, or promotion to leadership. Does this pattern suggest that women's economic empowerment requires complementary interventions beyond employment — and if so, what should those interventions look like?"
