  "content": "## Background\n\nSomalia has lacked a fully functioning central government since the collapse of the Siad Barre regime in 1991, making it one of the most prolonged cases of state failure in modern history. The absence of a functioning banking regulatory framework, coupled with decades of civil war, destroyed the formal financial sector. By the 2000s, Somalia had virtually no commercial banking system, with fewer than 50 bank branches operating across the entire country, mostly in Mogadishu and the relatively stable self-declared republic of Somaliland.\n\nDespite this institutional vacuum, Somalia maintained a remarkably active economy driven by livestock exports, trade, and crucially, remittances from the estimated 1.5-2 million members of the Somali diaspora. Remittances, estimated at approximately US$1.4 billion annually by the World Bank, constitute roughly 23% of GDP and serve as the primary social safety net for millions of Somalis. The hawala system, an informal trust-based money transfer network, provided the backbone for both remittances and domestic commerce, with operators like Dahabshiil becoming major financial institutions in their own right.\n\nThe telecommunications sector, operating largely without government regulation, became one of Somalia's most dynamic industries. Hormuud Telecom, founded in 2002, grew into the country's largest mobile operator, providing some of the cheapest call rates in Africa. The company's success demonstrated that private enterprise could deliver services in the absence of state infrastructure, though the regulatory vacuum also raised concerns about accountability, consumer protection, and potential misuse.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nIn 2009, Hormuud Telecom launched EVC Plus (Electronic Voucher Card Plus), a mobile money platform that allowed users to store value on their phones, transfer money to other users, and make payments to merchants. The service built on the existing mobile phone infrastructure, requiring only a basic feature phone and a SIM card. Users could deposit and withdraw cash through a network of agents, typically small shopkeepers, who provided the cash-in/cash-out interface.\n\nEVC Plus rapidly became the dominant payment system in south-central Somalia, filling the void left by the absence of formal banking. Merchants, from market vendors to landlords, began accepting mobile money payments, and the system became integrated into daily economic life. Telesom, the dominant operator in Somaliland, launched its own Zaad platform, while Golis launched Sahal in Puntland. The mobile money ecosystem evolved to support salary payments, bill payments, humanitarian cash transfers by aid agencies, and connections to the international remittance corridor.\n\nThe integration with hawala remittance operators was a crucial innovation. Diaspora Somalis could send money through hawala operators, who would deliver the funds directly to recipients' mobile money accounts, reducing the need for physical cash delivery in insecure areas. International organizations including the World Food Programme and UNHCR began using mobile money platforms to deliver humanitarian assistance, finding it more efficient and secure than physical cash distribution in a conflict-affected environment.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nSomalia's mobile money adoption has been extraordinary by global standards. According to Altai Consulting and the World Bank (2017), approximately 73% of the Somali population over age 16 used mobile money services, the highest rate in Africa and among the highest in the world. The system processed an estimated 155 million transactions per month by 2017, with the total value of mobile money transactions significantly exceeding GDP, reflecting the velocity of money circulation through the platform.\n\nIazzolino (2015) conducted detailed ethnographic research on mobile money in Mogadishu, documenting how the technology transformed everyday economic practices. He found that mobile money reduced transaction costs, increased the speed of commerce, and provided a measure of financial security in an environment where carrying cash was dangerous. Market traders reported that mobile payments reduced losses from theft and counterfeiting, while the transaction record provided a rudimentary form of financial documentation in a society operating largely without formal contracts.\n\nThe humanitarian sector's adoption of mobile money for cash transfers represented a significant innovation. Drummond et al. (2015) at the IMF noted that Somalia's mobile money infrastructure provided a unique channel for delivering humanitarian assistance efficiently, with lower overhead costs than traditional distribution methods. During the 2011 and 2017 drought emergencies, mobile money enabled rapid disbursement of emergency cash transfers to affected populations in areas that would have been difficult or impossible to reach with physical cash.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe success of mobile money in Somalia raises significant concerns about financial regulation, money laundering, and terrorism financing. Al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group that controls large areas of south-central Somalia, is known to levy taxes on businesses including mobile money agents, and there are concerns that the mobile money system could be used for illicit financial flows. International banks have responded by \"de-risking,\" closing the correspondent banking accounts of Somali money transfer operators, threatening the remittance corridor that is a lifeline for millions.\n\nThe lack of regulatory oversight means there are no consumer protection mechanisms, no deposit insurance, and limited recourse for fraud or system failures. Telecom operators effectively function as unregulated banks, holding significant balances of customer funds without the prudential requirements that would apply to licensed financial institutions. The interoperability between competing mobile money platforms remains limited, creating fragmented networks that disadvantage users of smaller operators. Aden (2019) noted that the concentration of mobile money in the hands of a few telecom companies creates significant market power with little accountability.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Mobile money can achieve massive scale in fragile and conflict-affected states by filling institutional vacuums, demonstrating that financial inclusion does not necessarily require a functioning formal banking system.\n- The integration of mobile money with existing informal financial systems like hawala, rather than attempting to replace them, was critical to achieving rapid adoption and trust.\n- Humanitarian organizations can leverage mobile money infrastructure for more efficient and secure cash transfer delivery, but this requires investment in agent networks and beneficiary registration.\n- The absence of regulation, while enabling rapid innovation, creates serious risks related to consumer protection, market concentration, financial crime, and potential misuse by armed groups.\n- International de-risking responses that threaten remittance corridors can undermine the very financial inclusion that mobile money enables, requiring nuanced regulatory approaches for fragile states.\n\n## References\n\n- Iazzolino, G.
