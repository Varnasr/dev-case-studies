  "content": "## Background\n\nPeru is one of the world's leading mineral producers, ranking among the top global producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tin. Mining accounts for approximately 60% of Peru's export revenues and has been the primary driver of the country's macroeconomic growth since the early 2000s. The commodity super-cycle (2003–2013) drove mining investment and tax revenues to unprecedented levels.\n\nHowever, mining operations are concentrated in some of Peru's poorest and most rural regions — Cajamarca, Ancash, Cusco, Arequipa, and Puno — where indigenous and campesino communities depend on agriculture and water resources that mining operations can disrupt. The tension between national-level economic benefits and local-level environmental and social costs has been a defining feature of Peru's development challenges.\n\nThe mining canon (canon minero), reformed and strengthened by Law 27506 in 2001, was designed to address this tension by ensuring that mining regions benefited directly from extraction revenue.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe mining canon transfers 50% of the income tax paid by mining companies to subnational governments in the regions where extraction occurs. Distribution follows a formula: 10% to the district where the mine operates, 25% to the province, 40% to the region (department), and 25% to the regional government. The canon was complemented by additional revenue mechanisms: mining royalties (regalías), the special mining tax (2011), and the special mining gravamen.\n\nDuring the commodity boom, these transfers were enormous. In peak years (2007, 2012), total canon minero transfers exceeded $5 billion, transforming the fiscal position of mining regions. Cajamarca, home to the Yanacocha gold mine (Latin America's largest), and Ancash, host to the massive Antamina copper-zinc operation, received particularly large allocations.\n\nCritically, the law restricted canon spending to capital investment projects — infrastructure, equipment, and development projects — and prohibited its use for recurrent expenditures like salaries or operational costs. This restriction reflected a desire to ensure that temporary resource revenues were converted into lasting public assets rather than consumed. An additional provision earmarked a portion for scientific research and technological development through universities.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nAragón and Rud (2013) in the Quarterly Journal of Economics provided rigorous evidence of positive local economic effects from mining activity. Studying the Yanacocha gold mine's impact on Cajamarca, they found that mining operations increased real income by approximately 1.7% in the mine's local area of influence, primarily through backward linkages (local procurement) and demand effects (worker spending). The benefits extended to households not directly employed by the mine.\n\nLoayza, Mier y Terán, and Rigolini (2013) examined the broader relationship between mining and local development across Peru, finding that mining districts experienced higher consumption growth and lower poverty rates than comparable non-mining districts during the boom period. However, they also found evidence of \"local Dutch disease\" — mining districts saw their non-mining sectors contract as labor and resources were absorbed by the mining economy.\n\nDespite massive revenue transfers, the developmental impact of the canon was significantly undermined by low execution capacity. Municipal and regional governments in mining areas — many of which had small populations, limited bureaucratic capacity, and no experience managing large budgets — struggled to design, procure, and execute investment projects. Execution rates (the share of allocated investment budgets actually spent) averaged only 50–65%, with billions in canon funds accumulating unspent in government accounts.\n\nCastellares and Fourier (2018) documented how the capital investment restriction, while well-intentioned, created perverse outcomes: municipalities built stadiums, plazas, and ornamental infrastructure rather than investing in productive capacity, institutional strengthening, or maintenance of existing assets. The prohibition on recurrent spending meant that new infrastructure often deteriorated rapidly due to lack of maintenance funding.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nSocial conflict has been the most visible challenge. Peru's Defensoría del Pueblo (Ombudsman's Office) documented over 200 active social conflicts annually, with mining-related disputes constituting the majority. The most prominent was the conflict over the Conga gold and copper project in Cajamarca, proposed by Yanacocha's parent company Newmont Mining. Community opposition — focused on concerns that the project would destroy four mountain lakes critical for local water supply — led to massive protests in 2011–2012, the declaration of a state of emergency, several deaths, and the indefinite suspension of the project.\n\nThe Conga conflict illustrated a fundamental tension: the canon system was designed to compensate mining regions, but compensation could not resolve opposition rooted in concerns about water, environmental degradation, and cultural identity. Communities near mines often saw their water contaminated, agricultural land disrupted, and social fabric altered, while canon benefits were dispersed across the entire region.\n\nRevenue volatility compounded governance challenges. Canon transfers fluctuated dramatically with commodity prices — falling by over 50% between 2012 and 2016 as copper and gold prices declined — making long-term planning impossible for dependent municipalities.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Revenue sharing from extractive industries to local governments is insufficient without parallel investment in local government capacity to plan, procure, and execute development projects\n- Restricting resource revenues to capital investment can prevent consumption of windfall but creates perverse incentives if maintenance and operational funding are not addressed\n- Social conflicts around mining cannot be resolved through fiscal compensation alone; concerns about water, environment, and cultural impacts require meaningful prior consultation and environmental safeguards\n- Revenue volatility from commodity dependence makes long-term development planning extremely difficult for subnational governments\n- Local Dutch disease effects can undermine non-mining sectors in resource-rich regions, potentially increasing economic vulnerability when extraction declines\n\n## References\n\n1.
