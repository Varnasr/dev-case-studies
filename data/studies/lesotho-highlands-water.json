  "content": "## Background\n\nLesotho, a small mountainous kingdom of approximately 2.1 million people entirely surrounded by South Africa, possesses one significant natural resource: water. The highlands of Lesotho, rising to over 3,000 meters, capture substantial rainfall and snowmelt that feeds the headwaters of the Senqu (Orange) River system. Meanwhile, South Africa's industrial heartland in the Gauteng province (including Johannesburg and Pretoria), home to approximately 15 million people and generating roughly one-third of South Africa's GDP, faces chronic water scarcity due to its location on a dry plateau far from major water sources.\n\nThe concept of transferring water from Lesotho's highlands to South Africa dates to the 1950s, but political obstacles including Lesotho's colonial status and later the apartheid government's complicated relations with the independent kingdom delayed implementation. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) was finally agreed through a treaty signed in 1986 between the two governments, establishing the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) and the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) to implement the project.\n\nThe geopolitical context was significant. The 1986 treaty was signed shortly after South Africa-backed factions had overthrown the elected government of Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, raising questions about whether Lesotho's agreement was fully voluntary. The project offered South Africa a more cost-effective water source than alternatives such as desalination or pipeline transfers from more distant rivers, while Lesotho would receive royalties and hydroelectric power from a resource it could not otherwise exploit domestically.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nThe LHWP was designed in multiple phases. Phase I, constructed between 1991 and 2003, consisted of two major components: the Katse Dam (185 meters high, making it the tallest double-curvature arch dam in Africa) and the Mohale Dam (145 meters), connected by a 32-kilometer transfer tunnel. Water is transferred from these dams through the 82-kilometer Delivery Tunnel North into South Africa's Vaal River system, which supplies the Gauteng region. Phase I also included the Muela hydroelectric station (72 MW), providing power to Lesotho.\n\nPhase II, currently under construction, involves the Polihali Dam and a 38-kilometer transfer tunnel connecting it to the Katse reservoir. Phase II is estimated to cost approximately US$2.6 billion and is expected to increase total water delivery capacity significantly. Additional phases were originally envisioned but have not been formally agreed.\n\nThe water royalty payments, calculated based on the cost of the next-best alternative water source for South Africa, represent a significant revenue stream for Lesotho. Thamae and Pottinger (2006) documented how these royalties, amounting to approximately 5% of GDP annually, became one of the government's most important revenue sources, exceeding customs revenue from the Southern African Customs Union in some years. The royalty formula was designed to ensure Lesotho captured a share of the economic value of the water, not merely construction costs.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nThe LHWP has achieved its primary engineering objective: reliable water delivery to South Africa's Gauteng province. Phase I delivers approximately 30 cubic meters per second of water, significantly augmenting the Vaal River system's capacity. Without this water, Gauteng would face severe and potentially economically catastrophic water shortages. The engineering achievement is remarkable, involving some of the most challenging dam construction in Africa, tunneling through basalt mountains, and creating infrastructure that must operate reliably at high altitude in severe winter conditions.\n\nFor Lesotho, the royalty revenue has been transformative for the national budget. The LHDA estimates cumulative royalties exceeding US$1 billion since water delivery began. Royalties have funded government expenditure on education, health, and infrastructure, contributing to improvements in human development indicators. The Muela hydroelectric station provides domestically generated electricity, reducing dependence on imported power from South Africa's Eskom utility.\n\nHowever, the social costs were substantial. Thamae and Pottinger (2006), working with the International Rivers Network, documented the displacement of over 20,000 people by Phase I alone, with many more affected by loss of arable land, grazing areas, and access to natural resources in the inundation zones. Compensation programs were widely criticized as inadequate and poorly implemented. The LHDA's own studies found that many displaced households experienced significant declines in living standards despite compensation, with loss of productive agricultural land replaced by inadequate cash payments or resettlement on inferior land.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe LHWP became internationally infamous for a corruption scandal that was unprecedented in its scope and consequences. In 1999, Lesotho's government, with World Bank support, prosecuted the former CEO of the LHDA, Masupha Sole, for accepting bribes from multinational construction firms. Sole was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Subsequently, twelve major international companies, including firms from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and South Africa, were prosecuted in Lesotho's courts, with several convicted and fined. The case was groundbreaking as one of the first successful prosecutions of multinational bribery in a developing country's courts.\n\nEnvironmental impacts have been significant. The dams altered downstream river flows, affecting wetland ecosystems and communities dependent on seasonal flooding for agriculture. The inundation of valleys submerged culturally and ecologically important areas. Phase II's Polihali Dam will displace additional communities and further alter the Senqu River's hydrology. Critics including International Rivers have argued that the benefits of the project accrue disproportionately to South Africa's urban consumers and multinational construction firms, while the costs fall on Lesotho's rural poor.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Transboundary water projects can generate significant revenue for upstream countries, but the distribution of costs and benefits within the exporting country must be carefully managed to avoid deepening rural poverty.\n- Resettlement and compensation for communities displaced by large dams require sustained, well-funded programs that go beyond one-time payments to address long-term livelihood restoration and cultural loss.\n- The LHWP corruption case demonstrated that developing country governments can successfully prosecute multinational bribery when supported by international cooperation, setting an important precedent for global anti-corruption efforts.\n- Power asymmetries between large and small countries in transboundary resource negotiations require institutional safeguards to ensure equitable outcomes, as the Lesotho-South Africa dynamic illustrates.\n- Megaproject royalties, while financially significant, do not automatically translate into broad-based development without transparent governance of revenue allocation and expenditure.\n\n## References\n\n- Thamae, M., & Pottinger, L.
