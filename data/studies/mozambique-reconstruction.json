  "content": "## Background\n\nMozambique's civil war (1977-1992) was one of the most destructive conflicts in African history. The war between the Frelimo government and the Renamo rebel movement, fueled by Cold War proxy dynamics and apartheid South Africa's destabilization strategy, killed approximately one million people and displaced millions more. The conflict destroyed much of the country's infrastructure, with an estimated 40% of health centres, schools, and administrative buildings damaged or destroyed. By the early 1990s, Mozambique was the poorest country in the world, with GDP per capita below $100.\n\nThe war ended with the General Peace Agreement signed in Rome on October 4, 1992, mediated by the Community of Sant'Egidio, the Italian government, and the Catholic Church. The peace process included provisions for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants, the transformation of Renamo into a political party, and multiparty elections.\n\nMozambique's post-war recovery took place in the context of massive international engagement. The United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) deployed over 7,000 peacekeepers to oversee the peace process. Donors provided billions of dollars in aid, making Mozambique one of the most aid-dependent countries in the world, with official development assistance constituting approximately 25% of GNI through the 2000s.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nPost-war reconstruction involved multiple interlocking interventions. The immediate priorities were resettlement of refugees and displaced persons (approximately 1.7 million refugees returned from neighboring countries by 1996), demobilization of combatants from both sides, de-mining, and restoring basic services. The first multiparty elections in 1994 were broadly considered free and fair, with Renamo accepting the results, establishing a foundation for democratic governance.\n\nThe government pursued macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms in collaboration with the IMF and World Bank, including privatization of state enterprises, trade liberalization, and fiscal discipline. Economic recovery was rapid, driven initially by the peace dividend (the return of displaced populations to productive activity and the reopening of transport corridors) and sustained by substantial aid inflows and foreign investment.\n\nIn the agricultural sector, the government launched PROAGRI (Programa Nacional de Desenvolvimento Agrario) in 1999, a sector-wide approach (SWAp) that coordinated donor support to agricultural development through a single institutional and financial framework. PROAGRI aimed to strengthen agricultural research, extension, and market access for smallholder farmers, though its performance was mixed.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nMozambique's macroeconomic performance was impressive by any standard. GDP grew at an average of approximately 7% per year from 1993 to 2008, making it one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. Poverty declined from an estimated 69% in 1997 to 54% in 2003, according to national household survey data. Social indicators improved: primary school enrollment rose sharply, infant mortality declined, and basic infrastructure was progressively restored.\n\nHanlon's 1996 book *Peace Without Profit: How the IMF Blocks Rebuilding in Mozambique* provided an early critical analysis of the reconstruction process, arguing that structural adjustment conditionality imposed by international financial institutions constrained the government's ability to invest in public services and rebuild state capacity. Hanlon documented tensions between donor-driven macroeconomic orthodoxy and the imperatives of post-conflict reconstruction.\n\nInternational observers frequently cited Mozambique as a post-conflict success story, pointing to the combination of sustained peace, high economic growth, poverty reduction, and democratic governance. The 2005 and 2009 elections, while increasingly contested, maintained the framework of multiparty competition.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe success narrative began to unravel in the 2010s. The discovery of massive natural gas reserves in the Rovuma Basin in 2010 generated expectations of transformative revenues but also intensified competition for resource control. In 2013, Renamo returned to sporadic armed conflict, shattering the assumption that the peace process was irreversible. Political tensions escalated, and the security situation in central Mozambique deteriorated.\n\nIn 2016, it was revealed that the government had secretly guaranteed $2 billion in commercial loans for state-owned security companies, the so-called \"hidden debt\" scandal. The revelation triggered a fiscal crisis, donor withdrawal, and a debt default. The scandal exposed deep governance failures and corruption at the highest levels, undermining the narrative of Mozambique as a model of post-conflict institution building. From 2017 onward, a violent jihadist insurgency in Cabo Delgado province further destabilized the country, displacing hundreds of thousands and threatening gas development. The Mozambican trajectory illustrates how fragile post-conflict gains can be and how natural resource discoveries can destabilize as much as they benefit.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Post-conflict economic recovery can be rapid when peace enables displaced populations to resume productive activity and reopens trade and transport corridors.\n- Heavy aid dependence can sustain growth in the medium term but creates vulnerabilities and does not automatically build domestic institutional capacity.\n- Sector-wide approaches (SWAps) in agriculture and other sectors offer potential for donor coordination but require strong government ownership and implementation capacity.\n- Post-conflict peace is not irreversible; unresolved political grievances and competition for natural resource rents can reignite conflict even after decades of stability.\n- Governance institutions must be genuinely strengthened, not merely maintained in form; the hidden debt scandal revealed that the appearance of good governance masked deep corruption.\n\n## References\n\n- Hanlon, J.
