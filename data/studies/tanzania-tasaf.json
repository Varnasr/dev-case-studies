  "content": "## Background\n\nTanzania entered the new millennium with deep poverty. According to the Household Budget Survey, approximately 36% of the population lived below the national basic needs poverty line in 2000. Rural areas were particularly affected, with limited access to health services, education, and infrastructure. Despite steady economic growth averaging around 5% annually through the 1990s, poverty reduction was slow and uneven, with gains concentrated in urban areas.\n\nThe government recognized the need for a social protection mechanism to address chronic poverty and vulnerability, particularly for communities unable to benefit from economic growth alone. In 2000, with International Development Association (IDA) financing from the World Bank, Tanzania launched the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) as a community-driven development (CDD) programme targeting the poorest communities.\n\nTASAF I (2000–2005) focused on community sub-projects in infrastructure, services, and capacity building. TASAF II (2005–2013) expanded coverage and refined targeting mechanisms. The programme's most significant transformation came with TASAF III, launched in 2012 as the Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN), which introduced conditional cash transfers and systematized public works employment.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nTASAF III represented a fundamental shift from project-based community development to a structured national safety net. The programme had three core components. First, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) provided regular bimonthly payments to extremely poor households, with basic transfers of approximately TSh 10,000 per month (around $6) plus variable amounts linked to children's school attendance and health clinic visits. Second, a public works component offered seasonal employment on community infrastructure projects, providing 15 days of paid work per month during lean agricultural seasons. Third, a livelihood enhancement component supported savings groups and skills development.\n\nTargeting used a combination of geographic methods (identifying the poorest communities using national census data), community-based wealth ranking (where community members identified the poorest households among them), and proxy means testing to verify eligibility. This hybrid approach aimed to balance statistical accuracy with local knowledge and community legitimacy.\n\nBy 2018, the PSSN reached approximately 1.1 million households across all 161 local government authorities in mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar, covering an estimated 5.4 million individuals. The World Bank provided $300 million in IDA financing for TASAF III, supplemented by government co-financing.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nA rigorous impact evaluation by Evans et al. (2014), using a randomized phase-in design, found significant positive effects of the PSSN on consumption, food security, and investment in children's human capital. Beneficiary households increased food consumption by approximately 8%, and the share of children attending school increased meaningfully. The evaluation also found evidence that households invested some of the transfers in productive activities, including small livestock and agricultural inputs.\n\nThe public works component showed mixed but generally positive results. Participants earned income during the lean season when they were most vulnerable, and the infrastructure built (roads, irrigation channels, soil conservation) provided broader community benefits. However, wage rates were set low to encourage self-targeting, and the seasonal nature of employment limited its impact on chronic poverty.\n\nA 2019 World Bank review found that the PSSN contributed to poverty reduction among beneficiaries and that the programme's targeting, while imperfect, was reasonably pro-poor. Tanzania's national poverty rate declined from 33.6% in 2007 to 26.4% in 2018, though this reduction reflected multiple factors beyond TASAF alone, including overall economic growth.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nSeveral challenges have limited TASAF's effectiveness. Transfer amounts remain low relative to the depth of poverty, with monthly payments insufficient to move households above the poverty line. Payment delays have been a persistent problem, undermining the predictability that makes safety nets effective. Targeting errors, both inclusion of non-poor households and exclusion of eligible ones, have been documented, partly reflecting the difficulties of community-based targeting in contexts where local power dynamics can distort selection.\n\nScaling up from a pilot programme to national coverage strained administrative capacity. Some critics have questioned whether the CDD heritage of TASAF, with its emphasis on community participation, has been adequately preserved in the shift to a centrally managed safety net. There are also sustainability concerns, as the programme remains heavily dependent on World Bank financing.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Phased programme evolution, from CDD to structured safety net, allowed institutional learning and gradual capacity building.\n- Hybrid targeting approaches combining statistical methods with community knowledge can improve both accuracy and local legitimacy.\n- Conditional cash transfers can simultaneously address immediate poverty and longer-term human capital investment, but transfer levels must be adequate.\n- Public works programmes can provide timely income support during lean seasons while building community infrastructure.\n- Long-term sustainability requires transitioning from donor financing to domestic revenue, which remains a challenge for low-income countries.\n\n## References\n\n- Evans, D.
