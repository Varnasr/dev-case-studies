  "content": "## Background\n\nIndonesia's palm oil sector expanded dramatically from the 1990s onward, driven by rising global demand for vegetable oils used in food, cosmetics, and biofuels. Production grew from roughly 4 million tons in 1990 to over 59 million tons by 2023, making Indonesia the world's largest producer, accounting for approximately 59% of global output. The expansion was concentrated in Sumatra and Kalimantan, where vast tracts of tropical rainforest and peatland were converted to plantations.\n\nThe sector became central to Indonesia's economy and rural development. Palm oil is the country's largest agricultural export, and the industry directly employs an estimated 4.2 million workers, with another 12 million in related livelihoods. Smallholder farmers produce roughly 40% of total output, and studies have documented significant poverty reduction in communities where oil palm was adopted. Households engaged in palm oil cultivation have measurably higher incomes than those in other agricultural sectors.\n\nHowever, the expansion came at an enormous environmental cost. Carlson et al. (2012) documented that oil palm plantations were a leading direct driver of deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan, with deforestation for palm oil accelerating particularly between 2000 and 2010. Indonesia's tropical forests are among the most biodiverse on Earth, harboring critically endangered species including Sumatran orangutans, tigers, and rhinoceroses.\n\n## The Intervention\n\nMultiple interventions have been attempted to reconcile palm oil production with environmental protection. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), established in 2004, created a voluntary certification system requiring members to avoid primary forest conversion, protect high conservation value areas, and respect community land rights. By 2023, approximately 4.5 million hectares were RSPO-certified, representing roughly 19% of global palm oil production.\n\nThe Indonesian government introduced its own sustainability standard, ISPO (Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil), made mandatory for all producers in 2011. The government also declared a moratorium on new concessions in primary forests and peatlands in 2011, made permanent in 2019 by President Jokowi. Corporate zero-deforestation commitments by major buyers like Wilmar, Unilever, and Nestlé further reshaped supply chain governance from the demand side.\n\nThe European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), adopted in 2023, represented the most significant demand-side intervention by requiring that commodities including palm oil imported to the EU be deforestation-free. This regulation has significant implications for Indonesian exporters, though the EU represents only about 15% of Indonesia's palm oil exports, with India and China being larger markets with less stringent requirements.\n\n## Results & Evidence\n\nDeforestation rates within oil palm concessions in Indonesia have declined since peaking around 2012. Austin et al. (2019) found that the moratorium and corporate commitments contributed to reduced primary forest clearing in concessions, though displacement of deforestation to non-concession areas and to non-moratorium land categories partially offset these gains. Primary forest loss in Indonesia fell from approximately 1.09 million hectares in 2016 to about 0.42 million hectares in 2022, though multiple factors contributed to this decline.\n\nThe 2015 peatland fires, exacerbated by El Niño and drainage for plantations, burned over 2.6 million hectares and produced an estimated 1.62 billion tons of CO₂-equivalent emissions according to World Bank analysis—briefly making Indonesia one of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters. The catastrophe prompted the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG), which targeted restoration of 2.49 million hectares.\n\nSmallholder impacts remain mixed. While palm oil has raised incomes, many independent smallholders lack RSPO certification and face exclusion from certified supply chains. Studies by Euler et al. (2017) in Sumatra found that oil palm adoption doubled incomes among smallholders, but also increased inequality, with larger landholders capturing disproportionate gains.\n\n## Challenges & Criticisms\n\nThe effectiveness of voluntary certification remains contested. A study by Carlson et al. (2018) found that RSPO certification had limited additional impact on reducing deforestation because companies tended to certify already-compliant plantations rather than changing behavior in high-risk areas. The proliferation of standards—RSPO, ISPO, MSPO (Malaysia)—creates complexity without necessarily ensuring environmental outcomes.\n\nLand conflicts between companies and indigenous communities are widespread. The Forest Peoples Programme and others have documented numerous cases where customary land rights were ignored during concession allocation. Indonesia's palm oil export ban in 2022, intended to control domestic cooking oil prices, disrupted global markets and highlighted the tension between domestic food security and export-led development. The fundamental trade-off between the livelihoods of millions of smallholders and global environmental objectives remains unresolved.\n\n## Key Lessons\n\n- Commodity-driven development can achieve rapid poverty reduction but may generate environmental externalities of global significance, requiring governance at multiple scales.\n- Voluntary sustainability standards have limited effectiveness without regulatory backing and comprehensive coverage of entire landscapes, not just individual concessions.\n- Demand-side regulations like the EUDR can shift incentives but may redirect trade to less regulated markets rather than reducing overall deforestation.\n- Smallholder inclusion is essential for both equity and effectiveness—excluding small producers from certified supply chains imposes costs on the poorest participants.\n- Peatland management is a critical climate issue; the 2015 fires demonstrated that agricultural expansion on peat carries catastrophic climate risks.\n\n## References\n\n- Carlson, K.
